Thy fingers make early flowers of 

all things. 

thy hair mostly the hours love: 

a smoothness which 

sings, saying 

(though love be a day) 

do not fear, we will go amaying. 

thy whitest feet crisply are straying. 

Always 

thy moist eyes are at kisses playing, 

whose strangeness much 

says; singing 

(though love be a day) 

for which girl art thou flowers bringing? 

To be thy lips is a sweet thing 

and small. 

Death, Thee i call rich beyond wishing 

if this thou catch, 

else missing. 

(though love be a day 

and life be nothing, it shall not stop kissing).

All in green went my love riding 
on a great horse of gold 
into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
the merry deer ran before. 

Fleeter be they than dappled dreams 
the swift sweet deer 
the red rare deer. 

Four red roebuck at a white water 
the cruel bugle sang before. 

Horn at hip went my love riding 
riding the echo down 
..into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
the level meadows ran before. 

Softer be they than slippered sleep 
the lean lithe deer 
the fleet flown deer. 

Four fleet does at a gold valley 
the famished arrow sang before. 

Bow at belt went my love riding 
riding the mountain down 
into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
the sheer peaks ran before. 



Paler be they than daunting death 
the sleek slim deer 
the tall tense deer. 

Four tall stags at a green mountain 
the lucky hunter sang before. 

All in green went my love riding 
on a great horse of gold 
into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
my heart fell dead before.

when god lets my body be 

From each brave eye shall sprout a tree 
fruit that dangles therefrom 

the purpled world will dance upon 
Between my lips which did sing 

a rose shall beget the spring 

that maidens whom passion wastes 

will lay between their little breasts 
My strong fingers beneath the snow 

Into strenuous birds shall go 
my love walking in the grass 

, their wings will touch with her face 
and all the while shall my heart be 

With the bulge and nuzzle of the sea

the Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls 

are unbeautiful and have comfortable minds 

(also, with the church's protestant blessings 

daughters, unscented shapeless spirited) 

they believe in Christ and Longfellow, both dead, 

are invariably interested in so many things 

at the present writing one still finds 

delighted fingers knitting for the is it Poles? 

perhaps. While permanent faces coyly bandy 

scandal of Mrs. N and Professor D

Cambridge if sometimes in its box of

it may not always be so; and i say 

that if your lips, which i have loved, should touch 

another's, and your dear strong fingers clutch 

his heart, as mine in time not far away; 

if on another's face your sweet hair lay 

in such a silence as i know, or such 

great writhing words as, uttering overmuch, 

stand helplessly before the spirit at bay; 

if this should be, i say if this should be 
you of my heart, send me a little word; 
that i may go unto him, and take his hands, 
saying, Accept all happiness from me. 
Then shall i turn my face, and hear one bird 
sing terribly afar in the lost lands.

suppose 

Life is an old man carrying flowers on his head. 

young death sits in a caf6 

smiling, a piece of money held between 

his thumb and first finger 

(i say "will he buy flowers" to you 
and "Death is young 
life wears velour trousers 
life totters, life has a beard" i 

say to you who are silent. "Do you see 

Life? he is there and here,

asleep, on his head 

flawers, always crying 

to nobody something about les

and my love slowly answered I think so. But 
I think I see someone else 

there is a lady, whose name is Afterwards 
she is sitting beside young death, is slender; 
likes flowers.

Spring is like a perhaps hand 

(which comes carefully 

out of No where) arranging 

a window,into which people look (while 

people stare 

arranging and changing placing 

carefully there a strange 

thing and a known thing here) and 

changing everything carefully 

spring is like a perhaps 

Hand in a window 

(carefully to 

and fro moving New and 

Old things,while 

people stare carefully 

moving a perhaps 

fraction of flower here placing 

an inch of air there) and 

without breaking anything.

who knows if the moon's 
a balloon,coming out of a keen city 
in the sky filled with pretty people? 
(and if you and i should 

get into it,if they 

should take me and take you into their balloon, 

why then 

we'd go up higher with all the pretty people 

than houses and steeples and clouds: 
go sailing 

away and away sailing into a keen 
city which nobody's ever visited, where 

always 

it's 

Spring) and everyone's 
in love and flowers pick themselves

i like my body when it is with your 

body. It is so quite new a thing. 

Muscles better and nerves more. 

i like your body, i like what it does, 

i like its hows, i like to feel the spine 

of your body and its bones, and the trembling 

-firm-smooth ness and which i will 

again and again and again 

kiss, i like kissing this and that of you, 

i like, slowly stroking the, shocking fuzz 

of your electric fur, and what-is-it comes 

over parting flesh .... And eyes big love-crumbs, 

and possibly i like the thrill 
of under me you so quite new

little tree 

little silent Christmas tree 

you are so little 

you are more like a flower 

who found you in the green forest 
and were you very sorry to come away? 
see i will comfort you 
because you smell so sweetly 

i will kiss your cool bark 
and hug you safe and tight 
just as your mother would, 
only don't be afraid 

look the spangles 

that sleep all the year in a dark box 

dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine, 

the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads, 

put up your little arms 

and i'll give them all to you to hold 

every finger shall have its ring 

and there won't be a single place dark or unhappy 

then when you're quite dressed 

you'll stand in the window for everyone to see 

and how they'll stare! 

oh but you'll be very proud 

and my little sister and i will take hands 
and looking up at our beautiful tree 
we'll dance and sing 
"Noel Noel' 1

Humanity i love you 

because you would rather black the boots of 
success than enquire whose soul dangles from his 
watch-chain which would be embarrassing for both 

parties and because you 

unflinchingly applaud all 

songs containing the words country home and 

mother when sung at the old howard 

Humanity i love you because 
when you're hard up you pawn your 
intelligence to buy a drink and when 
you're flush pride keeps 

you from the pawn shop and 
because you are continually committing 
nuisances but more 
especially in your own house 

Humanity i love you because you 
are perpetually putting the secret of 
life in your pants and forgetting 
it's there and sitting down 

on it 

and because you are 

forever making poems in the lap 

of death Humanity 

i hate you

nobody loses all the time 

i had an uncle named 

Sol who was a born failure and 

nearly everybody said he should have gone 

into vaudeville perhaps because my Uncle Sol could 

sing McCann He Was A Diver on Xmas Eve like Hell Itself which 

may or may not account for the fact that my Uncle 

Sol indulged in that possibly most inexcusable 

of all to use a highfalootin phrase 

luxuries that is or to 

wit farming and be

my Uncle Sol's farm 
failed because the chickens 
ate the vegetables so 
my Uncle Sol had a 
chicken farm till the 
skunks ate the chickens when 

my Uncle Sol 

had a skunk farm but 

the skunks caught cold and 

died and so 

my Uncle Sol imitated the 

skunks in a subtle manner 

or by drowning himself in the watertank 
but somebody who'd given my Uncle Sol a Victo

him upon the auspicious occasion of his decease a 
scrumptious not to mention splendiferous funeral with 
tall boys in black gloves and flowers and everything and

flowers guess and miss 

machinery is the more accurate, yes 

it delivers the goods, Heaven knows 

(yet are we mindful, though not as yet awake, 
of ourselves which shout and cling, being 
for a little while and which easily break 
in spite of the best overseeing) 

i mean that the blond absence of any program

makes unimportant what i and you believe; 

not for philosophy does this rose give a damn . . . 

bring on your fireworks, which are a mixed 
splendor of piston and of pistil; very well 
provided an instant may be fixed 
so that it will not rub, like any other pastel.

are for kissing and to sing with 
who cares if some oneeyed son of a bitch 
invents an instrument to measure Spring with?

why then to Hell with that: the other; this,

i sing of Olaf glad and big 

whose warmest heart recoiled at war: 

a conscientious object-or 

his wellbeloved colonel (trig 
westpointer most succinctly bred) 
took erring Olaf soon in hand; 
but though an host of overjoyed 
noncoms( first knocking on the head 
him) do through icy waters roll 
that helplessness which others stroke 
with brushes recently employed 
anent this muddy toiletbowl, 
while kindred intellects evoke 
allegiance per blunt instruments 
Olaf (being to all intents 
a corpse and wanting any rag 
upon what God unto him gave) 
responds,without getting annoyed 
"I will not kiss your f.ing flag" 

straightway the silver bird looked grave 
(departing hurriedly to shave) 

but though all kinds of officers 
(a yearning nation's blueeyed pride) 
their passive prey did kick and curse 
until for wear their clarion 
voices and boots were much the worse, 
and egged the firstclassprivates on 
his rectum wickedly to tease 
by means of skilfully applied 
bayonets roasted hot with heat 
Olaf (upon what were once knees) 
does almost ceaselessly repeat 
"there is some s. I will not eat" 



37 



our president,being of which 
assertions duly notified 
threw the yellowsonofabitch 
into a dungeon,where he died 

Christ (of His mercy infinite)

preponderatingly because 
unless statistics lie he was 
more brave than me: more blond than you.

a clown's smirk in the skull of a baboon 

(where once good lips stalked or eyes firmly stirred) 

my mirror gives me,on this afternoon; 

i am a shape that can but eat and turd 

ere with the dirt death shall him vastly gird, 

a coward waiting clumsily to cease 

whom every perfect thing meanwhile doth miss; 

a hand's impression in an empty glove, 

a soon forgotten tune,a house for lease. 

I have never loved you dear as now i love 

behold this fool who,in the month of June, 

having of certain stars and planets heard, 

rose very slowly in a tight balloon 

until the smallening world became absurd; 

him did an archer spy (whose aim had erred 

never) and by that little trick or this 

he shot the aeronaut down,into the abyss 

and wonderfully i fell through the green groove 

of twilight,striking into many a piece. 

I have never loved you dear as now i love 

god's terrible face,brighter than a spoon, 

collects the image of one fatal word; 

so that my life (which liked the sun and the moon) 

resembles something that has not occurred: 

i am a birdcage without any bird, 

a collar looking for a dog,a kiss 

without lips;a prayer lacking any knees 

but something beats within my shirt to prove 

he is undead who,living,noone is. 

I have never loved you dear as now i love. 



Hell (by most humble me which shall increase) 
open thy fire! for i have had some bliss 
of one small lady upon earth above; 
to whom i cry,remembering her face, 
i have never loved you dear as now i love 



34 



if i love You 

(thickness means 

worlds inhabited by roamingly 

stern bright faeries 

if you love 

me) distance is mind carefully 
luminous with innumerable gnomes 
Of complete dream 

if we love each (shyly) 
other, what clouds do or Silently 
Flowers resembles beauty 
less than our breathing 



43 



somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond 
any experience,your eyes have their silence: 
in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me, 
or which i cannot touch because they are too near 

your slightest look easily will unclose me 

though i have closed myself as fingers, 

you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens 

(touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose 

or if your wish be to close me,i and 
my life will shut very beautifully ,suddenly, 
as when the heart of this flower imagines 
the snow carefully everywhere descending; 

Clothing which we are to perceive in this world equals 
the power of your intense fragility: whose texture 
compels me with the colour of its countries, 
rendering death and forever with each breathing

but if a living dance upon dead minds 
why,it is love;but at the earliest spear 
of sun perfectly should disappear 
moon's utmost magic,or stones speak or one 
name control more incredible splendor than 
our merely universe,love's also there: 
and being here imprisoned,tortured here 
love everywhere exploding maims and blinds 
(but surely does not forget,perish,sleep 
cannot be photographed,measured;disdains 
the trivial labelling of punctual brains. . . 
Who wields a poem huger than the grave? 
from only Whom shall time no refuge keep 
though all the weird worlds must be opened?

they sowed their isn't they reaped their same

children guessed (but only a few 

and down they forgot as up they grew

that noone loved him more by more 

when by now and tree by leaf 
she laughed his joy she cried his grief 
bird by snow and stir by still 
anyone's any was all to her 

someones married their everyones 
laughed their cryings and did their dance 
(sleep wake hope and then) they 
said their nevers they slept their dream 

stars rain sun moon 

(and only the snow can begin to explain 
how children are apt to forget to remember 
with up so floating many bells down) 

one day anyone died i guess 
(and noone stooped to kiss his face)

my father moved through dooms of love 
through sames of am through haves of give, 
singing each morning out of each night 
my father moved through depths of height 

this motionless forgetful where 
turned at his glance to shining here; 
that if (so timid air is firm) 
under his eyes would stir and squirm 

newly as from unburied which 
floats the first who,his april touch 
drove sleeping selves to swarm their fates 
woke dreamers to their ghostly roots 

and should some why completely weep 
my father's fingers brought her sleep: 
vainly no smallest voice might cry 
for he could feel the mountains grow. 

Lifting the valleys of the sea 
my father moved through griefs of joy; 
praising a forehead called the moon 
singing desire into begin 

joy was his song and joy so pure 
a heart of star by him could steer 
and pure so now and now so yes 
the wrists of twilight would rejoice 

keen as midsummer's keen beyond 
conceiving mind of sun will stand, 
so strictly (over utmost him 
so hugely) stood my father's dream 



his flesh was flesh his blood was blood: 
no hungry man but wished him food; 
no cripple wouldn't creep one mile 
uphill to only see him smile. 

Scorning the pomp of must and shall 
my father moved through dooms of feel; 
his anger was as right as rain 
his pity was as green as grain 

septembering arms of year extend 
less humbly wealth to foe and friend 
than he to foolish and to wise 
offered immeasurable is 

proudly and (by octobering flame 
beckoned) as earth will downward climb, 
so naked for immortal work 
his shoulders marched against the dark 

his sorrow was as true as bread: 

no liar looked him in the head; 

if every friend became his foe 

he'd laugh and build a world with snow. 

My father moved through theys of we, 
singing each new leaf out of each tree 
(and every child was sure that spring 
danced when she heard my father sing) 

then let men kill which cannot share, 
let blood and flesh be mud and mire, 
scheming imagine,passion willed, 
freedom a drug that's bought and sold 



giving to steal and cruel kind, 
a heart to fear,to doubt a mind, 
to differ a disease of same, 
conform the pinnacle of am 

though dull were all we taste as bright, 
bitter all utterly things sweet, 
maggoty minus and dumb death 
all we inherit,all bequeath 

and nothing quite so least as truth 

i say though hate were why men breathe- 

because my father lived his soul 

love is the whole and more than all

love is the every only god 

who spoke this earth so glad and big 
even a thing all small and sad 
man,may his mighty briefness dig 

for love beginning means return 

seas who could sing so deep and strong 

one queerying wave will whitely yearn . 
from each last shore and home come young 

so truly perfectly the skies 

by merciful love whispered were, 

completes its brightness with your eyes 

any illimitable star 



66 



love is more thicker than forget 
more thinner than recall 
more seldom than a wave is wet 
more frequent than to fail 

it is most mad and moonly 
and less it shall unbe 
than all the sea which only 
is deeper than the sea 

love is less always than to win 
less never than alive 
less bigger than the least begin 
less littler than forgive 

it is most sane and sunly 
and more it cannot die 
than all the sky which only 
is higher than the sky

hate blows a bubble of despair into 
hugeness world system universe and bang 
fear buries a tomorrow under woe 
and up comes yesterday most green and young 

pleasure and pain are merely surfaces 
(one itself showing,itself hiding one) 
life's only and true value neither is 
love makes the little thickness of the coin 

comes here a man would have from madame death 
neverless now and without winter spring? 
she'll spin that spirit her own fingers with 
and give him nothing (if he should not sing) 

how much more than enough for both of us 
darling. And if i sing you are my voice, 



68 



what freedom's not some under's mere above 
but breathing yes which fear will never no? 
measureless our pure living complete love 
whose doom is beauty and its fate to grow 

shall hate confound the wise? doubt blind the brave? 
does mask wear face? have singings gone to say? 
here youngest selves yet younger selves conceive 
here's music's music and the day of day 

are worlds collapsing? any was a glove 
but i'm and you are actual either hand 
is when for sale? forever is to give 
and on forever's very now we stand 

nor a first rose explodes but shall increase

one stands supreme i mean the an

Huge this collective pseudobeast

does nothing except preexist 
its hoi in its polloi 

and if sometimes he's prodded forth 
to exercise her vote 

(or made by threats of something worth 
than death to change their coat 

which something as you'll never guess 
in fifty thousand years 
equals the quote and unquote loss 
of liberty my dears 

or even is compelled to fight 
itself from tame to teem) 
still doth our hero contemplate 
in raptures of undream 

that strictly (and how)scienti 
fie land of supernod 
where freedom is compulsory 
and only man is god. 

Without a heart the animal 
is very very kind 
so kind it wouldn't like a soul

unwish through curving wherewhen till unwish 
returns on its unself. 

A world of made 
is not a world of born pity poor flesh 

and trees,poor stars and stones,but never this 
fine specimen of hypermagical 

ultraomnipotence. We doctors know 

a hopeless case if listen: there's a hell 
of a good universe next door;let's go 



74 



one's not half two. It's two are halves of one: 
which halves reintegrating,shall occur 
no death and any quantity;but than 
all numerable mosts the actual more 

minds ignorant of stern miraculous 
this every truth beware of heartless them 
(given the scalpel,they dissect a kiss; 
or,sold the reason,they undream a dream) 

one is the song which fiends and angels sing: 
all murdering lies by mortals told make two. 
Let liars wilt,repaying life they're loaned; 
we(by a gift called dying born)must grow 

deep in dark least ourselves remembering 
love only rides his year. 

All lose,whole find 



75 



what if a much of a which of a wind 
gives the truth to summer's lie; 
bloodies with dizzying leaves the sun 
and yanks immortal stars awry? 
Blow king to beggar and queen to seem 
(blow friend to fiend: blow space to time) 
when skies are hanged and oceans drowned, 
the single secret will still be man 

what if a keen of a lean wind flays 
screaming hills with sleet and snow: 
strangles valleys by ropes of thing 
and stifles forests in white ago? 
Blow hope to terror;blow seeing to blind 
(blow pity to envy and soul to mind) 
whose hearts are mountains, roots are trees, 
it's they shall cry hello to the spring 

what if a dawn of a doom of a dream 
bites this universe in two, 
peels forever out of his grave 
and sprinkles nowhere with me and you? 
Blow soon to never and never to twice 
(blow life to isn't: blow death to was) 
all nothing's only our hugest home; 
the most who die,the more we live 



76 



no man,if men are gods;but if gods must 
be men,the sometimes only man is this 
(most common, for each anguish is his grief; 
and,for his joy is more than joy,most rare) 

a fiend,if fiends speak truth ;if angels burn 

by their own generous completely light, 
an angel;or(as various worlds he'll spurn 
rather than fail immeasurable fate) 
coward,clown,traitor,idiot,dreamer,beast 

such was a poet and shall be and is 

who'll solve the depths of horror to defend 
a sunbeam's architecture with his life: 
and carve immortal jungles of despair 
to hold a mountain's heartbeat in his hand

nothing false and possible is love 
(who's imagined,therefore limitless) 
love's to giving as to keeping's give; 
as yes is to if , love is to yes 

must's a schoolroom in the month of may: 
life's the deathboard where all now turns when 
(love's a universe beyond obey 
or command,reality or un-) 

proudly depths above why's first because 
(faith's last doubt and humbly heights below) 
kneeling, we true lovers pray that us 
will ourselves continue to outgrow 

all whose mosts if you have known and i've 
only we our least begin to guess

true lovers in each happening of their hearts 
live longer than all which and every who; 
despite what fear denies,what hope asserts, 
what falsest both disprove by proving true 

(all doubts,all certainties, as villains strive 
and heroes through the mere mind's poor pretend 
grim comics of duration: only love 
immortally occurs beyond the mind) 

such a forever is love's any now 

and her each here is such an everywhere, 

even more true would truest lovers grow 

if out of midnight dropped more suns than are

To set that soaring joy 

Lone in high air, 

What heavens were robbed of delight 

By their Emperor! 

He casts the angelic lights 
Into the clay 
Where immortality 
Lasts but a day. 
In the field of time 
The King has His play. 

He steals from His treasures 
The starry and pure 
To light a passion 
That may not endure. 

The astral lights 

In earth grow dim, 

And fade in the darkness 

Denying Him: 

They die in the darkness, 

Lost seraphim!

Were His hands not holding

SEA HOLLY 

BEGOTTEN by the meeting of rock with rock, 

The mating of rock and rock, rocks gnashing 

together ; 

Created so, and yet forgetful, walks 
The seaward path, puts up her left hand, shades 
Blue eyes, the eyes of rock, to see better 
In slanting light the ancient sheep (which kneels 
Biting the grass) the while her other hand, 
Hooking the wicker handle, turns the basket 
Of eggs. The sea is high today. The eggs 
Are cheaper. The sea is blown from the southwest 
Confused, taking up sand and mud in waves, 
The waves break, sluggish, in brown foam, the wind 
Disperses (on the sheep and hawthorn) spray 
And on her cheeks, the cheeks engendered of rock, 
And eyes, the color of rock. The left hand 
Falls from the eyes, and undecided slides 
Over the left breast on which muslin lightly 
Rests, touching the nipple, and then down 
The hollow side, virgin as rock, and bitterly 
Caresses the blue hip. 

It was for this, 

This obtuse taking of the seaward path, 
This stupid hearing of larks, this hooking 
Of wicker, this absent observation of sheep 
Kneeling in harsh sea-grass, the cool hand shading 
The spray-stung eyes it was for this the rock 
3 



Smote itself. The sea is higher today, 
And eggs are cheaper. The eyes of rock take in 
The seaward path that winds toward the sea, 
The thistle-prodder, old woman under a bonnet, 
Forking the thistles, her back against the sea, 
Pausing, with hard hands on the handle, peering 
With rock eyes from her bonnet. 

It was for this, 

This rock-lipped facing of brown waves, half sand 
And half water, this tentative hand that slides 
Over the breast of rock, and into the hollow 
Soft side of muslin rock, and then fiercely 
Almost as rock against the hip of rock 
It was for this in midnight the rocks met, 
And dithered together, cracking and smoking. 

It was for this, 

Barren beauty, barrenness of rock that aches 
On the seaward path, seeing the fruitful sea, 
Hearing the lark of rock that sings, smelling 
The rock-flower of hawthorn, sweetness of rock 
It was for this, stone pain in the stony heart, 
The rock loved and labored; and all is lost. 

CONRAD AIKEN. 



PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST IN DEATH 

MAGNIFICENTLY quiet he lies as if 
The vast repose in all his work were caught 
Now in these features. Marble was not stiff 
That his hands fashioned and here death has 

wrought 

The same swift grace. O hold epitome 
Of the high, lonely labor of the master. 
Presumptuous death but immortality 
Resides not here pitiably fast and faster 
This work will fade this replica of dust 
Tomorrow, tomorrow will be terribly gone 
Death's feeble art that could not stand one thrust 
Of time, but time will trouble not the stone 
He graved. Consummate this but fugitive 
The hand is still that could have made it live. 

KENNETH SLADE ALLING. 



SONG 

NOTHING I have is worth a tear 
Books and papers, gauds and gear. 
Happier beetle spread on his back 
Than I boxed up with this what d'ye-lack. 

What makes man as he stands? 

Head, belly and hands: 
Three to serve one, and the world goes on. 

Once Fd a heart, but they did not approve it, 
Slit up my side, and let them remove it, 
Since Fve been good they have given to me 
Paper galore, and much good may it do me. 

What brings man relief? 

Bread, pudding and beef. 
Three kinds of food; paper's no good. 

Soldiers tell me fighting's no frolic, 
Wise men tell me love is a colic, 
Bishops tell me learning's a lie 
Somebody tells me that I must die. 

What shall serve man then? 

Sword, sonnet or pen? 
All things must fall : God help us all ! 

E N, DA C. ANDRADE. 



THE NAIAD 

FROST-BOUND the garden stands. 

The claws of the frost are sharp upon my hands. 

On the harsh lawn each blade of grass 

Is tempered to a brittle spear of glass. 

The fountain is crystal-hung: its waters fail. 

Wilted to colourless, frail 
Paper the tender flesh of the flowers. 

The Dryads are gone from the tree, 
For the leaves are gone, the delicate leafy towers 
Dismantled, bared, to the iron anatomy 
Not even a bird could hide in. But hid within 
In the hollow trunk, the knees drawn up to the chin, 
Hugging herself each shivering Dryad sleeps, 

And frozen Echo leaps 

From her dream when my footfalls knock 

In a motionless, soundless world, 

On a pathway hard as rock. 

No flutter, no song of bird 

Nor bubbling flute is heard, 
Nor laughter of green-eyed Satyr. The Satyr, 

curled 
In his ice-hung cave, is shaken with torpid fear; 

For the days of lust are over 

And cold are the loved and the lover 

And the birthday of Christ draws near. 
Smooth flows the stream, its shallow bank ice-coated, 

And the pool where the lilies floated 
Is glazed with a polished pane as black as flint 
7 



And fringed with a delicate wreath 

Of crystal leaves. But a hint 

Of water moving beneath 
Draws my eyes. Pale, pale through the polished 

glass, 
Sweet naked body and wavering hair pass 

Pallid as death, fluid as water. 
ghost of Arethusa, Spring's first daughter, 
Beating vain hands against your crystal ceiling! 
hands imploring, O white lips appealing, 
Stirred and parted by syllables unheard! 
See, with a sharp-edged stone I crack the pane. 

The pale lips part again 

And the leafless garden thrills to the delicate ring 
Of a small, clear call from Naiad or hidden bird, 
From water or air, crying "The Spring! The 
Spring!" 

MARTIN ARMSTRONG. 



PORTRAIT 

THE lips so apt for deeds of passion 
The hair to stifle a man's breath 
The symmetry of form beneath 
An Irish mackintosh, the wild 
Defiant pupils of a child. 
The gods responsible for these 
Whatever else to blame one sees 
Were artists in their fashion. 

But left the signature unwritten 
Too early tired; 'twas strange to botch 
A masterpiece, but we who watch 
Horizons to redress the wrong 
See only Gotterdammerung. 
Not one of us, except in dreams, 
Can alter by a word it seems 
The story that is written, 

Which has no happy marriage-ending. 
A story, which we know, will fail 
To turn romantic fairy tale, 
For neither friendliness nor tears 
Have hands to push away the years, 
We can but turn our eyes away 
Before the last act of the play 
And its unlovely ending.

STEEL 

i 

THIS man is dead. 
Everything you can say 
Is now quite definitely said : 
This man held up his head 
And had his day, 

Then turned his head a little to one way 
And slept instead. 

Young horses give up their pride: 
You break them in 
By brief metallic discipline 
And something else beside. . . . 
So this man died. 

While he lived I did not know 

This man; I never heard 

His name. Now that he lies as though 

He were remembering some word 

He had forgotten yesterday or so, 

It seems a bit absurd 

That his blank lids and matted hair should grow 

Suddenly familiar. , . . Let him be interred. 

Steady now. . . . That was his wife 
Making that small queer inarticulate sound 
Like a knife; 

Steady there. . . . Let him slip easy into the 
ground ; 

10 



Do not look at her, 
She is fighting for hreath. . . . 
She is a foreigner. , . . 

Polak . . . like him . . . she cannot under- 
stand. . . . 

It is hard. . . . Leave her alone with death 
And a shovelful of sand. 

"0 the pity of it, the pity of it, lago!" . . . 
Christ, what a hell 

Is packed into that line! Each syllable 
Bleeds when you say it ... No matter: Chicago 
Is a far cry from Cracow; 
And anyhow 
What have Poles 

To do with such extraneous things as hearts and 
souls? 

There is nothing here to beat the breast over, 

Nothing to relish the curious, 

Not a smell of the romantic; this fellow 

Was hardly your yearning lover 

Frustrated; no punchinello; 

But just a hunky in a steel mill. Why then fuss 

Because his heavy Slavic face went yellow 

With the roaring furnace dust? Now that he is in 

The cool sweet crush of dirt, to hell with your 

sobbing violin, 
Your sanctimonious 'cello ! 
Let the mill bellow! 

11 



II 

If you have ever had to do with steel : 
The open-hearth, the blooming-mill, the cranes 
Howling under a fifty-ton load, trains 
Yowling in the black pits where you reel 
Groggily across a sluice of orange fire, a sheet 
Tongued from the conduits that bubble blue green; 

if 

Ever you have got a single whiff 
Out of the Bessemer's belly, felt the drag 
And drip and curdle of steel spit hissing against 

hot slag; 

If ever you have had to cat 
One hundred and thirty degrees of solid heat. 
Then screwed the hose to the spigot, drowned in 

steam, 

Darted back when the rods kicked up a stream 
Of fluid steel and had to duck the ladle that slob- 
bered over, and scream 

Your throat raw to get your Goddam! through 
Then I am talking to you. 

Steve did that for ten years with quiet eyes, 

And body down to the belt caked wet 

With hardening cinder splash and stiffening sweat 

And whatever else there is that clots and never 

utterly dries. 

He packed the mud and dolomite, made back-wall, 
12 



Herded the heat, and placed his throw In tall 
Terrible arcs behind smoked glasses, and watched it 

fall 

Heavy and straight and true, 
While the blower kept the gas at a growl and the 

brew 
Yelled red and the melter hollered "Heow!" and 

you raveled 

Her out and the thick soup gargled and you traveled 
Like the devil to get out from under. . . . Well, 

Steve 

For ten years of abdominal heft and heave 
Worked steel. So much for that. And after 
Ten years of night shifts, fourteen hours each, 
The Bessemers burn your nerves up, bleach 
i Rebellion out of your hones ; and laughter 
Sucked clean out of your guts becomes 
More dead than yesterday's feet moving to yester- 
day's drums. . . . 
And so they called him "Dummy." The whole 

gang 

From pit boss down to the last mud-slinger cursed 
And squirted tobacco juice in a hot and mixed 

harangue 
Of Slovene, Serb, Dutch, Dago, Russian, and 

worst 

English as hard and toothless as a skull. 
And Steve stared straight ahead of him and his 

eyes were dull. 

13 



Anna was Steve's little woman 

Who labored bitterly enough, 

Making children of stern and tragic stuff 

And a rapture that was hammered rough, 

Spilling steel into their spines, yet keeping them 

wistful and human. . . . 
Anna had her work to do 
With cooking and cleaning 
And washing the window curtains white as new, 
Washing them till they wore through: 
For her the white curtains had a meaning 
And starching them white against the savage will 
Of the grim dust belching incessantly out of the 

mill; 
Soaking and scrubbing and ironing against that 

gritty reek 

Until her head swam and her knees went weak 
And she could hardly speak. 
A terrible unbeaten purpose persisted : 
Color crying against a colorless world! 
White against black at the windows flung up, un- 
furled! 

Candles and candle light! 
The flags of a lonely little woman twisted 
Out of her hunger for cool clean beauty, her hun- 
ger for white! 
These were her banners and this was her fight! 

No matter how tired she was, however she would 
ache 

14 



In every nerve, she must boil the meat and bake 
The bread, and the curtains must go up white f or 

Steve's sake ! 
One thing was certain : 
That John and Stanley and Helen and Mary and the 

baby Steven 

Must be kept out of the mills and the mill life, even 
If it meant that her man and she would break 
Under the brunt of it: she had talked it through 

with him 
A hundred times. . . . Let her eyeballs split, her 

head swim 
The window must have its curtain ! 

ill 

Lately Steve had stopped talking altogether 

When he slumped in with his dinner pail and 

heavily 

Hunched over his food. 
So Anna and the children let him be; 
She was afraid to ask him why or whether 
As he sat with his eyes glued 
On vacancy. 

So Anna and the children let him brood. 
Only sometimes he would suddenly look at them 

and her 

In a ghastly fixed blur 

Till a vast nausea of terror and compassion stood 
Blundering in her heart and swarming in her 

blood 

15 



And she shivered and knew somehow that it was 
not good. 

And then it happened: Spring had come 
Like the silver needle-note of a fife, 
Like a white plume and a green lance and a glitter- 
ing knife 

And a jubilant drum. 
But Steve did not hear the earth hum: 
Under the earth he could feel merely the fever 
And the shock of roots of steel forever; 
April had no business with the pit 
Or the people call them people who breathed 

in it. 

The mill was Steve's huge harlot and his head 
Lay between breasts of steel on a steel bed, 
Locked in a steel sleep and his hands were riveted. 



IV 

And then it happened: nobody could tell whose 
Fault it was, but a torrent of steel broke loose, 
Trapped twenty men in the hot frothy mess. . . . 
After a week, more or less, 
The company, with appropriate finesse, 
Having allowed the families time to move, 
Expressed a swift proprietary love 
By shoving the dump of metal and flesh and shoes 
And cotton and cloth and felt 
Back in the furnace to remelt. 
16 



And that was all, though a dispatch so neat, 

So wholly admirable, so totally sweet, 

Could not but stick in Steve's dulled brain. 

And whether it was the stink or the noise or just 

plain 

Inertia combined with heat, 
Steve, one forenoon, on stark deliberate feet, 
Let the charging-machine's long iron finger beat 
The side of his skull in. ... There was no pain. 

For one fierce instant of unconsciousness 

Steve tasted the incalculable caress; 

For one entire day he slept between 

Sheets that were white and cool, embalmed and 

clean ; 

For twenty-four hours he touched the hair of death, 
Ran his fingers through it, and it was a deep dark 

green 
And he held his breath. 

This man is dead. 

Everything you can say 

Is now quite definitely said.

TO A MAN SLEEPING IN A SUBWAY TRAIN 

MAN, you are ugly, 

Excruciatingly ugly, 

Sleeping in this train 

That hurtles your graceless self 

Through the black veins of the city. 

Yours is the sleep of a sodden lethargy; 
Yours is the sleep of a conscious death; 
Yours is the sleep of the masses. 

Man, you are ugly, 
Sleeping in this crowded train, 
Where men's eyes spit contempt at you, 
And men's lips write smirking sneers 
Within the secret pages of their minds : 
You know these pitying smiles 
Curling in the corners of men's mouths. 

Man, you are ugly, 

Sleeping so, 

Unguarded by your little conceits. 

Your face shrieks out the dumbness of the clod 

Louder than the faces of cows. 

There is a heavy stupidness about your eyes and 

mouth. 
Known of mute beasts only. 



19 



Man, you are ugly, 

Sleeping so, 

Sleeping the sleep of the masses. 

I would shake your limp shoulders, 

Even with the mighty hands of revolt, 

I would wake you, 

Even with the terrible hands of pain, 

And cry: 

Hear you not the tender voice of beauty 
Whose lips press close to the earth 
Above the subway's darkness, 
That you may hear? 

And cry: 

Hear you not the swift feet of the wind 
Running down the sun splashed street 
Over your head, 
That you may follow? 

And cry: 

Good God, man, wake up, 
You are ugly, 
Sleeping so, 
Sleeping the sleep of the masses.

IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD 

EARTH is a quicksand; yon square tower 

Would still seem bold, 
But its bleak flinty strength each hour 

Is losing hold. 

Small sound of grasping undertow 

In this green bed! 
Who shuts the gate will shut it slow, 

Here sleep the dead! 

Here sleep, or slept; here, chance, they sleep, 

Though still this soil 
As mad and clammed as shoals acreep 

Around them boil. 

The earth slips down to the low brown 

Moss-eaten wall, 
Each year, and nettles and grasses drown 

Its crumbling crawl. 

The dog-rose and ox-daisies on 

Time's tide come twirling, 
And bubble and die where Joy is gone 

Sleep well, my darling. 

Seldom the sexton with shrewd grin, 

Near thy grave-cloth, 
With withered step and mumble thin 

Awakes eve's moth. 

21 



Not a farm boy will dare destroy, 

Through red-toothed nettles, 
The chiff-chaff's nest, and strew the shells 

Like fallen petals. 

The silver-hooded moth upsprings, 

The silver hour, 
And wanders on with happy wings 

By the hush tower 

That reels and whirrs and never drops, 

But still is going, 
For quicksand not an instant stops 

Its deadly flowing. 

And is Joy up and dancing there 

Where deepening hlue 
Asks a new star? and is her hair 

There freshed with dew? 

Here O, the skull of some small wretch, 
Some slaughtered jot 

Bones, white as leaf-strigs or chopped twitch- 
Thus turned fate's plot. 

So lies thy skull? This earth, even this, 

Like quicksand weaves. 
Sleep well, my darling, though I kiss 

Lime or dead leaves. 

22 



Sleep in the flux as on the breast. 

In the vortex loll; 
In mid simoon, rny innocence, rest, 

In lightning's soul. 

Bower thyself! But, joyous eyes, 

The deeps drag dull 
O morning smile and song, so lies 

Thy tiny skull?

THE SON OF MAN 

MATTHEW and Mark and Luke and John 
Say God was good to look upon. 
He bringeth light into the dark, 
He bringeth balm for sin and cark. 
So said Matthew and Luke and John, 
And so said that apostle, Mark. 

I do not doubt a word they said, 
But I'm alive and they are dead. 
I am alive, and Luke and John, 
Matthew and Mark, all are gone. 
They have no call to earn their bread, 
This Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and John. 

There was a town Jerusalem, 
And a village called Bethlehem. 
And up beside a land-locked sea 
A little place called Galilee. 
And here were Gods, and one of them, 
Or so they say, did die for me. 

So say Matthew, Luke, and John, 
And so says Mark, the other one. 
But I, who was not there to see, 
I cannot think how it should be. 
And Luke and John and Mark are gone, 
And scribing Matthew, so is he. 
24 



I doubt not they had thoughts like mine, 
And liked the girls and loved the wine. 
I doubt not once they wasted breath 
Like I do here, in Nazareth. 
Nor doubt they thought their God divine 
By that long lake, Gennesareth. 

By Jericho or Babylon 

Sleep Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and John. 

Or maybe in Gethsemane 

Or Magdala or Bethany. 

Where'er it be in Gibbithon 

I know they sleep nor think of me. 

I know they sleep, nor think of God, 
Nor think of me beneath his rod. 
They sleep so sound and fancy-free 
They do not know how God hurts me. 
O never now they think of God, 
Never now of God or me. 

O Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and John, 

How wearily I travel on. 

O when shall I be up and free 

Of this sad load you left to me? 

Hard is the bed I lie upon, 

Hard as the rocks on Calvary.

SENTIMENTALITY 

SENTIMENTALITY, 
You win the love of men 
Who look upon you as a soft 
And indiscreetly reassuring minx. 
You stand upon the street corner 
Of their trysts and felonies. 
Underneath your glance 
Their disappointments grow less harsh 
And assume a charmed, theatrical pose, 
While their momentary victories 
Feel an ardent ownership of life. 
Again, to other men you seem 
Obnoxious, cloying, and replete 
With remedies that merely drug the wound. 
To them, you wander through the sharp 
And carnal vagaries of life, 
And make the faces of men and women 
Blind beneath your perfumed handkerchief. 
Yet, you are none of the figures 
Engraved upon you by the needs of men. 
You stand, invincibly compassionate; 
Disguised by frail, poetic mockeries; 
Held up by an ephemeral erectness 
Whose finely knitted lies 
Are often better than the stripped 
And grossly stooping honesties of life. 
You wait for men to corrupt you 
With their snivelings and heavy smiles, 
26 



But at your best you add 
A quickly graceful, valiant compensation 
To the underpaid and slowly wilting 
Slaveries of minds and hearts. 

MAXWELL BODENHEIM.

DEEDS UNDONE 

HE scorned the gifts that fortune brought, 

And smiled, and went his way; 
For some men still regard I ought 

As greater than I may. 

The path he trod forgot the sun 

In unillumined length; 
But deeds that he had never done 

Gave him a giant's strength. 

GAMALIEL BRADFORD. 



28 



EL GALLO 

THEY waited, sleeping, on the plaza benches 
Until we woke them to the moon at midnight; 
And then between the whitened walls they followed, 
Playing and singing. A violinist joined them. 
We had never seen him before; he had been in the 

fields. 

From one of the houses came a clarinet 
And down from the moon a dozen blanketed 

figures . , . 
And we danced folk-dances in the market-place. 

With half the night before us and no more bottles, 
We knocked at several doors, naming them brother, 
And then at a shuttered window and called it 

darling, 

And we saw it coming open with a candle; 
Shakes of the head, entreaty, no relenting, 
Someone asleep there in the room behind her; 
Eyes in the moonlight, lips of silent laughter, 
And at last through the window a bottle of pome- 
granate wine. 

Later she came herself and opened a booth 
Under the stars; and on a charcoal fire 
Heating the water for our cinnamon-tea, 
She poured into every bowl a little glass 
Of alcohol and gave new draughts of life 
To the driver of the bus, a shoemaker, 
29 



Seven musicians, three soldiers with their guns, 
A boot-black and a bo'atman and ourselves. 

After our cinnamon-tea with its alcohol, 

We carried the blacksmith harpist to his bed, 

And, making sure that he was sound asleep, 

We spent an hour on the cobblestones 

With serenades to the blacksmith's beautiful 

daughter . . . 

And then we sang, with twenty-seven songs, 
Good-night to the moon, good-morning to the sun, 
And felt our fellowship to the point of tears. 

From my western balcony-window, I watched the 

light 

Deepen under solid leaves along the hill 
And under ledges I had never seen 
On the mountain-range and sharpen the sides of 

boats . . . 

And so it had been under my ribs with music 
And with wine, a lovely deepening of the light 
A body carries on its own small hill : 
I laughed aloud, joining bright earth with earth, 

WITTER BYNNER. 



30 



THE INTRUDER 

QUIETLY from the cottage door he crept, 
And slipped into the shadow of the night. 
But as he fled, I called upon him, "Death! 
Oh coward, have you touched them while they 
slept?" 

The Shape heard nothing; only crouched and fled. 

Then I crossed the threshold; trod the stair, 
And stood within the chamber of the dead. 
But when I looked; Oh miracle of breath! 
The dark marauder had not halted there. 

RICHARD CHURCH. 



31 



NIGHTFALL 

A SWALLOW soaring and dipping, 
And a seagull crying. 
These are the only living 
In a world that is dying. 

The sun is drowned in the marshes, 
His light quenched in the brakes. 
A shiver runs over the barley, 
And the wild grass quakes. 

The sea tide meets the river. 

Their waters, without a sound, 

Lock and wrestle in torment. 

Night shadows creep over the ground. 

RICHARD CHURCH.

THE HOUSE IN THE WEST 



Where low rains are heavier 
Than the sail in haze, 
And the cold sea is spread 
On the soil to raise harvest, 
Black calves are hred to reign over 
The fair and behind their green tether, 
In a bare land that halves every cloud, 
There is a great house. 



H 

Men with the crowbar, 
Breaking a road 
From the spar of the dark land. 
Have seen those far windows, 
While unyoking a cart-load, 
Take fire, and a star 
Coming over the water 
Like Oisin after the heroes. 

ill 

At darkrise the snipe 
Strum on the rain; 
But in that house, to the lighting 
Of rushes, the air of the bagpipe 
Blows a reel on the floor: 
33 



Big men strike in from a backward parish 
And two of them carry a slain boar 
Over the thoating of greyhounds. 



IV 

There is honey spitting from meat 

And whitening of the ale there, 

Brandy and wine that came from the seas, 

Bright candles and who that delight in 

The mind, counting those companies 

Of yellow-haired men or of women 

That never had envy, would not be pleased 

By the laughter, the music and chess-playing? 

AUSTIN CLARKE,

PIRATES 

PIRATES, after all, were usually 

Such young men! 

At yard-arms or docks they hanged them, 

Or on beaches now and then. 

So between the prayers of parsons 

At the gallows-tree 

In their ears came softly lisping 

The whisper of the sea. 

Their own sea of sails and fighting, 

Of storm and wound, 

Scattered with uncharted beaches 

For the men that they marooned; 

Spanish towns with plate and treasure; 

Jungle; fever; heat; 

And the clicking of the glasses 

In some safe retreat. 

In that school a man grew crafty, 

Limber in his hates. 

Their white scars were often left them 

By their bosom mates. 

What extraordinary stories 

That no one now can know 

Pied upon those wind-blown gallows 

At twenty- one or so ! 

ELISABETH COATSWORTH.

PREPARATION 

BLOND, primitive, among her props and stays 
The unfinished schooner towers from the sand. 
Her ribs still show gaunt shadows band by band 
In Viking savagery across the haze; 
Along the half -sheathed sides a pale light plays 
Prefiguring the lines her maker planned ; 
Here shall the masts with all their rigging stand 
And here the bowsprit rise above the sprays. 

All day the spar-makers are shaping spars, 
The rivet hammers pound, and the saws squeal, 
Her ribs are scored with white adze-bitten scars, 
The drunken scaffoldings about her reel. 
So that some night when the gale drowns the stars 
She may stamp down the storm beneath her keel! 

ELISABETH COATSWQRTH. 



36 



LESS THAN KIN 

HE was a hill man, 
And she watched the spray 
Until he came and won her 
All in a day. 

Sea-folk will talk all day, 
But mountain-folk are still 
And the tide dashes vainly 
Against a cliff's will. 

He knows not how to answer 
Her salt tide of talk. 
He goes no further from his hills 
Than a day's walk! 

Though she climb to roof or hill-top 
As if her soul to save, 
All that her eastward staring sees 
Is a hill-wave. 

Hill-folk cannot easily 
Speak what they feel, 
But his look follows her 
Like a dog at heel. 

Far up a hillside 
Seas cannot climb . . . 
Her tide of talk is going out 
Before its time. 

37 



Destiny that mated them 
Was less than kind or human; 
All in a day to tether 
Hill-man . . . sea-woman.

EPITAPH 

LIKE silver dew the tears of love, 

And gold's the smile of joy, 
But I had neither, silver, gold, 

Nor wit for their employ. 

I had no gifts or fancies fair 

This poverty to mend: 
I was the son of my father, 

And had no other friend. 

Though, he that brings no grist to mill 

May con the reckoning o'er, 
Who comes into the world with nought 

Can scarce go out with more. 

A. E. COPFARD. 



39 



THE SHADOW 

OF life and all its pleasure 

Would pleasure were its end! 
I would not stint the measure 

To enemy or friend. 
Let fate be sour or soothing, 

Untimely or towards. 
Live to enjoy each new thing, 

The dream that life affords. 

But there's a call supremer, 

An ultra-mundane goal. 
That wakens every dreamer, 

And pledges every soul; 
A quickening and a wonder 

That ever onward streams 
Of sounding deeds that thunder 

The emptiness of dreams. 

Yet, suns, for all their brightness, 

Burn not without a shade; 
The moon's imperial whiteness 

In blackest nets is laid 
Daedalian ages floated 

The bright ones on their way 
With shadows, still devoted, 

Not less, but more, than they. 
40 



So, life-enslaved, the spirit 

Endures a shadowy claim. 
And what is proved of merit 

Comes short of all its aim; 
Still, like a drowsy farer 

Whose dog behind him creeps, 
Goes on my soul, the sharer 

Of a shade that never sleeps. 

Some lewd or idle fancy 

Diverts its trembling fire, 
Or like a ghost unchancy 

Dogs all my fond desire; 
O strange phantasmagory 

That will not let me be! 
When I would follow glory 

My shadow follows me. 



A. E. COPPARD. 



41 



THE LOSS OF LOVE 

through an empty place I go, 
And find her not in any room; 
The candles and the lamps I light 
Go down hefore a wind of gloom. 

Thick-spraddled lies the dust about, 
A fit sad place to write her name, 
Or draw her face the way she looked 
That legendary night she came. 

The old house crumhles hit hy hit: 
Each day I hear the ominous thud 
That says another rent is there 
For winds to pierce and storms to flood. 

My orchards groan and sag with fruit, 
Where, Indian-wise, the bees go round; 
I let it rot upon the hough; 
I eat what falls upon the ground. 

The heavy cows go laboring 

In agony with clotted teats; 

My hands are slack; my blood is cold; 

I marvel that my heart still beats. 

I have no will to weep or sing, 
No least desire to pray or curse; 
The loss of love is a bitter thing: 
They lie who say that death is worse. 

COUNTEE CUULEN,

LINES FOR A TOMB 

RECITE the dangers chiselled on this face: 

How I was clipped by scorn and maimed hy lies; 

How conscience hedged my soul; law chilled my 

eyes; 
Ropes cut my grace. 

Recite therewith the flame of victories: 
How out of blood and dust I gathered mirth; 
And was content to find in flesh and earth 
Strange ecstasies. 

But most recite what made me captive here, 
Weighted with stone, wrapped in a sluggard's peace, 
And ask of men if this is God's release 
Or only his fear. 

DONALD DAVIDSON.

CROWNS 

LOVE'S touch is soft, and Death 

Is gentle, when he takes 
A sleeping child's light breath, 

Before it wakes; 
But neither Death nor Love 
Moves softer than I move. 
Great is my ecstasy, 
Till generous I 
For common pence have sold 
The world my purest gold. 
No man that's blind 

Has ears more quick to hear; 
No man that's deaf and dumb 

Has eyes more sharp and clear. 
No wonder then that kings, 
Envying the man who sings, 
Aspire to wear his crown 
And scorn their own; 
No wonder kings aspire 

For crowns not made of gold, 
Which though Time's born a thief 

Escape his hold. 
Two kings have won 
David and Solomon. 



W. H. DAVIES. 



44 



SPACE 

SCORN not because my body lives 

In such a little place; 
Think how my mind, on that account, 

Inhabits greater space. 

My smallest blossom sometimes is 

The Moon or setting Sun ; 
Seas are my pearls, and forests vast 

Have no more trees than one! 

The finest scarf or collar made, 

To keep a woman warm, 
By night or day, on sea or land, 

Is still a lover's arm, 

W. H. DAVIES.

DARK ELLEN 

DARK ELLEN was an honest lass, 

Yet beauty she had none, 
And foolish lads prize beauty more 

Then aught beneath the sun. 

And though at dawn she always rose 
And swept her cottage floor, 

No sweetheart ever sought her hand, 
No lover sought her door. 

She sat her down to spin her thread, 

Her bitter tears fell fast, 
She thought of all the days to come, 

All lonely like the past. 

"Why should a pretty face be all 

That lads want in a wife? 
A pretty face will lose its bloom, 

A good heart lasts through life. 

"If there be charms against the plague, 

Against the evil eye, 
If there be charms against the blight 

That falls upon the rye 

"If there be charms to bind a lad 

When once he loves a lass, 
Some magic there may be to bring 

Such happiness to pass.*' 
46 



What flies against the window-pane 

Though it is early morning? 
What hops within her open door 

As if to give her warning? 

Dark Ellen let the distaff fall 

And shuddered in her fear, 
Dark Ellen saw a bat, a toad, 

There in the sunlight clear. 

She heard the tap, tap of a stick 

Out on the smooth flagstones, 
She heard an owl hoot thrice, it froze 

The marrow in her bones. 

She stiffly turned and looked around, 

And there in her own cot 
Stood the old grey witch of Bloxton Hill 

That Satan had begot. 

Her withered skin scarce seemed to stretch 

Across each gaping bone, 
Her yellow eyes were like a cat's, 

With warts her neck was strewn. 

Her nose was like an eagle's beak, 

Her hands were like his claws, 
Her yellow teeth like cruel fangs 

Within her cruel jaws. 



47 



Dark Ellen shuddered where she stood 
And tried to say some word, 

Dark Ellen moved her parched lips, 
But yet no sound was heard. 

The old witch held one finger high 

And moved a little space, 
"Dark Ellen, I have magic brew 

To give a lovely face. 

"To-night when sets the crescent moon, 

And every wind is still, 
When in the copse my owl hoots thrice, 

Come up to Bloxton Hill." 

A hat flew by, a screech owl called 
From out the neighboring wood, 

She turned, and in an instant's space 
Was gone from where she stood. 

Dark Ellen sank upon her knees, 
Her breath caught in her throat, 

A mockingbird sang loud outside, 
She did not hear a note. 

To Bloxton Hill, where no good folk 

Would go for any gain? 
To Bloxton Hill, and if she went, 

Suppose she went in vain? 

48 



Yet that same night when crescent moon 
Was gone and winds were still, 

When thrice the owl had hooted, she 
Went up to Bloxton Hill. 

"Witch mother, do you brew to-night, 
And if so, what's your brew?" 

"Be still, ye five fiends, one and all, 
Till I have need of you." 

"Witch mother, do you brew for love, 

Or is it death you brew?" 
"They may be one, ye goblin 1 folk, 

But what is that to you? 

"Go search the graveyards far and wide, 

Be quick to do your part, 
Bring me a dead girFs once red lips, 

Bring me a dead man's heart. 

"Pick sere leaves from the sweetheart bush, 

Suck in the poppy's breath, 
Pluck me the henbane's fetid flower 

That only blooms for death.'* 

The green fire burns on Bloxton Hill, 

Yet feeds on wood nor peat, 
The green fire sets the pot a-boil, 

Yet none can feel its heat. 



49 



"Witch mother, who comes down the path 
That leads to Bloxton Hill?" 

"Now by my cauldron hanging there 
Ye goblin folk, be still, 

"Or ye will fright away the lass 

Go hide you in the wood!" 
She turned, and in that baleful light 

Dark Ellen trembling stood. 

"Say, Bloxton witch, what must I do, 
And what price must I pay?" 

Four bats they flew about her face, 
Four snakes around her lay. 

The witch's eyes gleam like a cat's, 
"The charm that I have made 

Is naught to hurt an honest lass, 
You need not be afraid. 

"Into a vial I shall pour 

This liquid of my brewing. 
Dark Ellen, take it home with you, 

The rest will be your doing. 

"For seven nights, then seven more, 

Before you go to bed, 
Put seven drops upon your hands, 

Pour seven on your head. 



50 



"And when those two se'nnights are past, 

And in the morn you rise, 
Look in your glass and see if then 

Dark Ellen meets your eyes. 5 * 

She fijled the vial with her brew, 

The liquid sparkled there 
And threw an odor strangely sweet 

Upon the evening air. 

"Hide well this flagon that I give, 

Let no one know its savor, 
Now get a lover and be wed 

Then I shall ask one favor." 

With trembling hands Dark Ellen took 

The vial for her own, 
The blood rushed through her veins and yet 

A chill cut to the bone. 

A great toad spat upon her arm, 

A dead hand brushed her face, 
She turned about with flying feet 

And left the loathsome place. 

Twice seven days are quickly sped, 

Twice seven nights soon pass, 
AncJ Ellen rose before the sun 

And looked her in the glass. 



51 



And there by that pale morning light 
Though candle she had none, 

She saw the loveliest face that she 
Had ever looked upon. 

Oh, wide her beauty's fame was spread, 

Dark Ellen she no more, 
Fair Ellen was she called by all 

Who sought her cottage door. 

The young squire heard and came to see, 

And stayed his love to tell, 
Oh, happy were they on the day 

When rang the wedding bell. 

Oh, happy were they in their love 
Till the turning of the year, 

Then Ellen heard a sound one night, 
And crossed herself in fear. 

She sat alone and in the wood 
She heard an owl hoot thrice, 

Trembling she laid her needle down, 
Her warm blood turned to ice. 

She heard a tap, tap in the hall, 

A tap, tap at her door, 
A bat flew in and there stood one 

That she had seen before. 



52 



The Bloxton witch has yellow eyes, 
And curved hands like claws, 

The Bloxton witch has teeth like fangs 
Within her hollow jaws. 

Fair Ellen shuddered in her chair 

But made her dry lips say: 
"You gave me beauty, Bloxton witch, 

What is the price I pay?" 

The Bloxton witch has wicked eyes, 

But softly does she speak, 
"The nights grow colder, Ellen Fair, 

A little warmth I seek. 

"Two arms are better than a fire 

To warm when one is cold, 
Two arms that reach out tenderly 

For one they love to hold. 

"Let me but take your place this night 
And lie by your husband's side, 

Let him think once that I am she 
Whom he still calls his bride." 

The old witch rubbed her withered hand 

Across her bony cheek, 
Fair Ellen sat there in her chair 

And did not move or speak. 



53 



At last her trembling lips made sound: 

* 6 My husband is too dear, 
Too kind, too loving, and too good 

For me to sell him here." 

The old witch laughed her evil laugh, 

"Your beauty won his heart, 
Could you as poor Dark Ellen keep 

Him yours by any art? 

"Fair Ellen, if your beauty stays 

As you can make it stay, 
Are there not other men that you 

Could wed another day?" 

"Why should I wish for other men 

Like bees around a bud? 
Oh, Bloxton witch, I know you now, 

You come to suck his blood! 

"I'll have no beauty at that price, 

Take every grace away! 
Make me as plain as ever I was 

Before that direful day!" 

The old witch laughed her wicked laugh, 

The bat flew past the door, 
Fair Ellen swooned from out her chair 

And fell upon the floor. 



54 



The squire sits in the council hall. 

Well pleased is he with life, 
He hears no word of what they say, 

He thinks of his young wife. 

But his grey mare has heard an owl 
Hoot three times in the wood, 

And his grey mare knows well enough 
She calls for nothing good. 

His grey mare whinnies where she stands 
And restless paws the ground, 

The young squire starts up from his seat 
And hurries at the sound. 

He leaps upon his horse's back 

And holds a loosened rein, 
The grey mare gallops down the road 

And gallops up the lane. 

What sound was that Fair Ellen heard 

As she lay swooning there? 
Her husband's hand was on the latch, 

His step was on the stair. 

She staggered to her looking glass, 

"Now am I no more fair?" 
She held the gutted candle high 

Dark Ellen she saw there. 



55 



She hid her face within her arm, 

The squire was at the door ? 
"Come in, my husband, you shall see 

Fair Ellen never more." 

He sat him down as in a dream 

And she knelt By his side, 
She sobbed her bitter tale and told 

How she became his bride. 

The squire caught up his dear young wife, 

And sat her on his knee, 
He gave her one long tender look, 

**I see no change," said he.

THE GIRL REMEMBERS HER DEAD LOVER 

OFTEN with damper paper, sticks, and straw 
I have made shift ere now to build a fire: 
There have been other mornings chill and raw 
As this is, yet not one when dry desire 
Smoldered so heavily in breast and limb, 
Smoldered so heavily because of him. 

The matches flare and splutter. Flame by flame 
The thick smoke smothers them. Their stubs are 

strewn 

About the hearth. . . . We play an ugly game, 
Despair and I, frozen in brain and bone, 
With dabbled fingers dicing all around 
In yesterday's gray ashes on the ground 

The coldness grows. The fire will never light, 

And presently the house will be astir 

With breakfast still to cook and nothing right 

And all to do, though I am wearier 

Than after a week's work or a long fever. 

Would it were over and done with now forever! 

EDWARD DAVISON. 



57 



THOUGHTS AT THE YEAR'S END 

DRAW a clean breath of crisp and moonless air; 

Fix eyes upon the dark; 

set ears to catch 

the knocking of the wind along the ground, 

whereto no grass replies, heing numb as wire. 

The traveling clock you carry everywhere 

about with you, the jewel of your bones, 

ticks with too little sound, 

keeping the time no other soul may share, 

making you know 

here's night, here's winter, here's year's end 

to bear 

once more, 

and without a god's help, now, 

without a devil, and without desire. 

O happy Egypt! most eloquent stones, 

heaped like a hill of thunder, frescoed in gold 

and black and rusted vermilion, 

to comfort a god, the son of the Sun, with riches. 

wise embalmers* 

bandages tightly wound, to keep the dignity of the 

Pharaoh's bones 

unbitten by any tooth, save, it may be, 
the envy of a slave. 

black marble nostrils, spread like wings, 
squat dark doorways 
open to eternal life. 

58 



We come upon you, fifty centuries having passed, 

we, the sorrowful heirs and assigns 

of your grave-treasure, your bread, your heart, your 

rings 

buried with you 
we remember, son of the Sun, 
that even the first Father, shining 
on the Moskva as on the Rhein, the Seine as on the 

Thames, the Hudson 
as on old Nile 
even the Sun is doomed, 
and dooms us in a little while. 

In His eyes 

two thousand years are as a moment. 

Now at the winter solstice, when the light is 

squeezed 

like a drop of watery chrome on the faded earth, 
to be lapped up by a brumous blotter of darkness, 
does He remember 

the long December night through which the chosen 
virgin labored to bring 
peace to the people? 
(Sing: 

holy, holy, holy, 
Lord God almighty!) 
He endured much 
the kiss of betrayal, 
the heavy way up the hard hill, 
the ropes, the nails, the spear, 
59 



the death agony, the slow, long rending, most the 

mockery 

He cast upon Himself when He cried out, 
"Elohai, Elohai, lama sabachthani?" 
That moment is over. 
And we, who have seen His peace 
shredded by Huns and Romans, priests and kings, 

rich men and rabble, 
we whom He could not save 
(Himself He could not save) 

now watch the wintry dark as a sick seaman watches 
his coldly tossing grave. 

But who are we 

that we should envy the Pharaoh, 

the Keeper of the House, who built his house 

forever, 
or that we 
should rate the God of the Hebrews, One and 

Eternal, 

because He turned into a Trinity, and, soon there- 
after, ceased? 
We are so small 

the fleas that crawled over behemoth bulked 
larger to that huge pasture than we to the stars, 
and to the night the blinking stars are less 
than fireflies to the whole wilderness. 
vanity 
of man! that would spin Cosmos out of a small 

gray clot 

60 



locked in a fragile shell. 

Say: God is not. 

Say: man dies, 

every man, alone 

(bite on this iron at midnight, when you lie 

sleepless, in bed, with half a life gone by, eaten 

away 
the day 

will be undone, 

love and ambition be ashy on your tongue, 
and oblivion 

will roll its weight upon you, ton and giant ton). 
Say: God is not, death's instant, history's 
a fever the moon died of 
what way now? 

There's no help in the hills, for they will crumble, 
nor in the skies, for earth is a dropped stitch 
in their pattern 

(but even to fumble, there must be Fingers, 
and for a pattern Mind) . . 

Reach out, reach out, you will touch nothing, 

you will find 

nothing, 

but yet reach, 

with the balked pressure of the blind on emptiness, 

reach, grope, seize, shape. 

Or, let the ice-blue winding-sheet 

that waits for earth 

61 



swaddle your infant wisdom at the birth, 

or, from the cracked bones of despair 

suck marrow, 

and bend Now 

backward and forward in your spirit's heat. 

And bear . . . and bear . . .

SYRIAN SONG 

SAID old Hafiz to Sihun the youth: 

"When Sorrow comes and enters at your door 
And you start up trembling and weep and wring 

your hands 
Be sure that Sorrow is yet but a stranger to you. 

"But when he enters to you and you do not stir, 

But keep on mending your old sandal, 

With your head a little on one side 

And your dull eyes on your work, 

Then may you say with assurance, 

c Yes, I know who it is. It is Sorrow.' " 

Louis DODGE,

FROM "HIPPOLYTUS TEMPORIZES' 

ACT II. SCENE I. 

(A strip of sea-coast.) 

Evening 

PHAEDRA: O how I hate, 

radiant, cold and drear, 

Greece with its headlands, 

Greece with icy fervour, 

Greece with its high encounter 

and endeavour, 

Greece and Greek cities 

for their arrogance, 

each with particular grace, 

each claiming god 

for some peculiar ardour, 

differing each from each, 

yet each complete, 

spirit, mind, arrogance 

of small material wealth, 

each soul unto itself; 

is there no merging, 

no hint of the east? 

no carelessness 

nor impetuousness of speech? 

can no one greet 

my south? 

64 



O glorious, 



red, wild pomegranate mouth? 

my heart breaks and burns, 

yet can not conquer, 

can not merge with this, 

this world of radiance and rock 

and ice and shale and peace. 

MYRRHINA: Cease, Cretan lady, 

queen of the red sands 
and the imperious peak 
of Ida 
where Zeus reigns. 

KHAEDRA: O how I hate 

this world, this west, this power 
that strives to reach 
through river, town or flower, 
the god or spirit that inhabits it; 
O, is it not enough to greet 
the red-rose 

for the red, red sweet of it? 
must we encounter 
with each separate flower, 
some god, some goddess? 
must each peculiar hour, 
dawn, day or night, 
take its particular prayer? 
why must we pause and bear 
65 



not only beauty 
of each beautiful thing, 
but suffer more, more, more, 
the associated spirit with its power? 
this tyranny of spirit 
that is Greece; 
speak, my Myrrhina, 
must I long endure 
this swarm of alien gods 
and this cold shore? 

MYRRHINA: O lady, lady, lady, 
luminous more 
than any spray of myrtle 
or white flower 

of the enchanted flowering citron-tree 
that flowers and fruits 
and each gleam separately, 
the wax-sweet petal 
by the fruit's rare gold, 
listen nor count as cold 
a land where purple decks your small- 
est ways, 

where a king follows 
courting through long days. 

PHAEDRA: What is the dotard love 
of a dull king, 
Myrrhina? I know 
what love might have been. 
66 



MYRRHINA: lady, lady, lady, 
luminous more 
than golden spray of orange 
or white flower 
of pearl and fire, 
the citron and its leaf, 
O glorious 
beyond belief, 
Phaedra, 
endure, 

have strength a little more; 
we shall prevail, 
we will outrule this pallid shore 
and sail 

back to bright Crete, 
its sun-lit slopes, its vales 
of orange, citron, 
its bright tree of myrtle; 
we will escape, 
radiant in all our power; 
listen, endure, 
O golden lily-flower. 

PHAEDRA: We all think, every one, 

sometime our power is broken, 
our fame gone, 
our beauty stricken, 
and our graciousness 
fit only for some dark and barren 
place, 

67 



where old, old women croak 
about the loom 
or pace and chatter 
graceless in the sun. 

MYRRHINA: Come, come 
my lady, 

myrrh-trees bend to bless 
in Crete, 
the very footfall 
where you pass. 

PHAEDRA: The tall myrrh-forest 
of my distant land 
has nothing now of loveliness, 
its sand 

white and pure gold 
that drifts beneath the steps 
of the king's built-up summer palaces, 
holds no more marvellous glint, 
nor any magic 

lures me with old enchantments 
and old songs; 

Crete shows dead and pallid 
by the flame 
and beauty 
that has given Greece its fame. 

Escape? 
escape? 



for me there is no place 
can hide his fervour, 
fervour of flame-lit face, 
beauty as of the god that flees the sun. 

MYRRHINA: Dearest, my lady, 

do not speak of this, 

O do not breathe, however faint, that 

name, 

peace, O my princess, 
think of your great fame, 
remember Crete and all those palaces, 
remember all the glitter of your dead, 
recall the mighty pleasaunce of the 

king 

your father, 

and the blue, blue of its walls, 
remember Phaedra is above all, all, 
a queen. 

PHAEDRA: Ah, friend, 
Myrrhina, 

once I might have been 
proud with gold head-dress 
like a flame-lit flower 
or candle set in some bright altar- 
niche; 

now I am stricken 
like a flame-struck bough. 

H. D. 



JASON AT CORINTH 

CRACKED, yellow, blistering, 

Salt-caked and gaping- every plank a wreck 

Between the eastern and the western seas, 

Her prow pushed forward to the rising sun, 

There stands the ship, the first ship made with 

hands : 

The mother of the fifty men who bore 
Her on their shoulders, nine days over the earth, 
Between the inner and the outer sea. 

And now their sons 

Are setting out for Troy. At Aulis gather 

A thousand ships black-sailed, vermillion-prowed, 

But none of my blood in them. I have naught, 

Nor wife nor child nor kin nor friend nor home; 

Only this staring wreck 

Where the rocks part the seas. 

Only this wreck at last, 

Rotting and nude and huge, 

And strength that fails in me, 

Snapping like these old beams; 

A dream of Colchis and the Golden Fleece 

Which other men have long forgot, 

A memory that fades and dies 

In one old weary brain. 

The sea is whispering to the young men's blood 
No more of my strange wandering; 
70 



It breaks into another song, 

Of Troy's high walls and Helen's face, 

And Priam's house of gold. 

Had I but known which of two ways to choose, 

I would have taken the safe, easy way; 

Assumed my kingship, married, and had sons, 

Traded in easy seas and sent at last 

A hundred sail to equal Agamemnon's 

Best-fitted host. 

But now 

This is the end, the very end, the last 

Of striving and the limit of my pain. 

The Gods have hidden this from me till now, 

But now I see the pathway I have trod, 

Marked with grey milestones blood and shame 

and tears 
Straggle at last, and stop. The House of Sleep 

Is open by the all -forgetting sea. 

And there I soon shall rest. No one will sing 

Of me as of Achilles and those men 

Now going to their doom. But yet, at times, 

Some men will speak of me in casual talk, 

And wondering what it was that stood between 

Me and my thwarted purpose, say this word: 

"So many toils he faced to lose his quest; 

So many griefs he found ere grief could sleep.'* 

JOHN GOULD FLETCHER. 
71 



TO ALMIGHTY GOD 

WITH your outlaws, God, let me stand up at the 

judgment; 
With those who blasphemed you because they 

sought you always; 
With those who denied you, because you denied 

yourself to them. 
With those who were broken upon the great terrible 

wheel of the earth. 
With those who hated themselves, because they 

loved you, 
With those who laboured against themselves because 

you cursed their labour, 
With those to whom life was vain struggle, and 

time was worth nothing but for a glimpse df 

your face, 
With your outlaws, God, I claim at last a place. 

Grant me, God, 

Not to know bodies only but the souls behind them; 

Not the green garment that the earth wears, but the 

fire of her naked breath, 
Not the blue-cloud-ridden sky but the song of the 

lark as it soars 
Like a young bridegroom, joyous, through the 

great mystery of those spaces. 
Let me look up at the stars and love them, lawless, 
Let me love men and women, even though you warn 

me not to love them. 
72 



Since all the temples made with hands fall into dust 

before your face, 
Since this song too is useless, a vain cry unheard 

and uncomprehended, 

Since I at bottom am lawless, and you have prom- 
ised and said, 
That the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and 

the violent shall take it by storm, 
Place me among the outlaws, the broken and weary, 

the followers of every lost cause upon earth. 
Make me now one of them, fill me with their fury, 

let me, as they, seek you face to face, 
Beyond the last illusion, where amid the shouting 

stars 
Throned upon fire, in garments sealed with eternal 

sacrifice 
Sacred and glorious, flesh and spirit fused and 

merged in one; 
You turn the great wheel of the world beneath your 

bleeding feet. 

JOHN GOULD FLETCHER.

THE WAXWORKS 

Madame TussaucFs Perished by Flame 
18 March 1925 

(Bartholomew Crump., janitor, died on Maundy 
Thursday 9 April 1925, three weeks after the 
burning.) 

"WHY are you wandering, Bartholomew, so sadly, 
With bony sharp chin plunged into your breast, 
And feet shimble-shamble and knees knock-a- 

knocking, 
And fingers a-twitching and eyes never at rest? 

"Men all must die, and were you immortal 

That now you look gloomy as tricked out of 

breath? 

Was life all so easy, age so delightful, 
That now so morosely you murmur at death? 

"Long ere you died you were dead, Bartholomew, 
And rattled your thigh-bones in mounting the stairs, 
And now like the dead that gloomed at you from 

cases, 
creaking Effigy! your glassy eye glares. 

"Even then, like the dead, your frogged uniform 
covered 

Scarce co-ordinate bones and creased parchment- 
like skin; 

74 



You smelt dusty and camphored to keep the moth 

from you, 
And your lungs but half filled and your heart beat 

thin. . . . 

"Long ere you died you were dead, and I pitied you. 
Why, then, now you've left all the counterfeit dead, 
And another in your frogged coat will cry, This 

way, please, 
Why's your hand shaking, dejected your head?" 

"I know you well. Sir, " 

"Speak up, I scarce hear you: 
Bless me, how your tongue hangs!" 

" Sir, I know you well, 

/ know you., I say. But 0, Sir, have patience. 
'Tis my grief that speaks O, how shall I tell!" 

"Take your time, Bartholomew a slice of Eternity 
Will never he missed, a thousand years is to run 
To twilight, and then five thousand to morning. 
Speak when you're ready: no never mind sit 
down." 

" 'Twas untrue that you spoke how long ere I died 
I was like all those dead, mere dust and a smell. 
Pd watched them, talked of them, ay, and listened 

when 
One another they whispered; 'twas like a low bell 



75 



"That goes rolling and returning from stone on to 

stone, 

For one note a hundred, then dying away. 
If I moved their looks followed me, when I rested 

they rested, 
I was wax to their wax, they were clay to my clay. 

"And all that is past! Now here am I, lonely, 
And like the dust sleeping when no wind stirs. 
And they too are perished and here am I, lonely, 
And no one to pity, for no one cares." 

" Poor silly Bartholomew! They were all un- 
real, 

Dumb figures, mere waxworks, simulacra and 
shows. 

Absurd you should think them alive and articulate, 

And now go lamenting that nobody knows! 

"Here in the world of the Shades, undying, 
Here all is simple and soothlike and dimmed 
Here are King, Pope, Courtier and ail Carnality, 
Queens, and supplanters of Queens light-limbed, 

"That was Helen paused here but a moment ago, 
And Mary the Scot paced proudly away; 
Lascivious Priests edged after the pair of them, 
And a starry Admiral glittered like day. 

"Here, Bartholomew, here's life indeed, 
Change-defeating and old Death outfacing, 
76 



All as they were and evermore shall be 

In the ancient habiliment and customed pacing. 

"Here's life, Bartholomew Life! What more?" 
" There's none of them here I knew, as I knew 

them. 

The ruddy are pale, the splendid are fallen, 
0, Sir, these are not as the artist once drew them. 

'Tis all my grief! the fire that up writhed 
Like a snake through the stairway's lit fissure and 

crept 

On a puffing air, and then like a Dragon, 
A dragonish Death, on the gallery leapt. 

"0 the smoke that lifted like a thick-leaved tree 
And then like a tree consumed in fierce flame, 
The flame's congregation that rose up and roared 
And spangled the hall with million gleam. 

"The fire froze me, I stiffened like one in a trance. 

Unstirring I stood, and useless to stir, 

With the drums of the fire on my ears rolling 

loudly 
And the eyes of the fire fixing my eyes with their 

glare." 

" You were crazed, Bartholomew, because your 

familiars 

Melted to nourish the flood with their wax. 
77 



'Twas remorse " 

"0, never remorse so bitter. 

'Twas my bones seemed to melt, my thin sinews 
relax. 

Maybe 'twas a moment, maybe 'twas a year, 
Maybe 'twas a dream and I already a ghost. 
But I saw and I beard as the Judgment Day break- 
Ing, 
And Archangels summoning the heavenly Host. 

The trumps and the fire called the sleepers from 

sleep, 
Glass shivered and cracked as the flame lifted its 

tongue. 
They stirred in bewilderment, they cried and I 

hearkened, 
And fain had cried back, but speechless hung." 

* 'Twas all but a witchery. In a pagan cavern 
A witch was melting their images slowly, 
And whispering an ancient spell and spinning 
Fatal syllables of a song unholy; 

'Twas this, Bartholomew." 

"'Twas the Judgment Day 
Rehearsed for warning of all evil livers. 
I heard their cries, I saw them appealing

Yearned as they melted. The lips that kissed 
The lips that smiled, grew suddenly piteous, 
And famous faces in a crazy twist 

Slipped into ruin that I could not read, 
While still the Archangels' shrilly blast 
Echoed, and I awoke from trance or dreaming, 
And fear beset me as I fled then and cast 

All behind in a moment's mad terror, 
All my old life, forgetting life to be, 
All my old familiars and accustomed faces, 
And fled back to safety and perplexity." 

" Why, Bartholomew, you, a lover of beauty? 
You, repining because of beauty past reach? 
You aesthetical, you, you sentimental, 
You an evangelist with trick of pious speech!" 

" It is easy to mock. It was not for beauty, 
'Twos because I had known them! that I loved so 

well. 

Not the beauties only, the brave and the lordly, 
But all those others, they too had a spell. 

Where now is Fred Archer, where is Dan Leno, 
Where's Horatio Bottomley and General Booth, 
Where's Bloody Mary and Charles the Second, 
And the Princes slain in the Tower in their youth? 
79 



O, and Napoleon, so marble and grand, 
And Marie Antoinette piteously bright, 
The wise-looking head of calm Robespierre, 
And Marat's fierce mouth and gaping sight? 

Where now is Neil Cream, where is poor Crippen, 
That died for women; where's Seddon now? 
Where's Charlie Peace and Palmer the poisoner, 
And Stinie Morison and Mahon and Lowe; 

And Smith that drowned his wives in a bath, 
And moat-farm Dougal and Southend Read; 
Where's Mrs. Dyer the baby-farmer, 
That were all hanged or jailed and now burned 
when dead? 

Where's Fowler and Milsom, blood-thirsting still, 
That died contending for each other's life; 
And Burke and Hare, those bloodier hunters, 
And the Mannings hanged public, 1 husband and 
wife? 

And that French Landru whose eyes flickered at me 
Whenever I turned and passed him by? 
All defaced or utterly melted, 
And no one to see and pity, but I." 

" Why, man, they were not all lost, and time 
Must needs have come when you watched them no 

more." 

" I know, I know, and 'tis bitter remembering, 
But bitter past bearing to think, No more! 

1 Witnessed by Herman Melville when he visited England 
in 1849 "a most wonderful, horrible and unspeakable 
scene/* 

80 



For O, Sir, I knew them, and often I fancied 
They knew me also and their look was kind. 
Year after year they had heard my slow footstep; 
To me their eyes no longer were blind. 

And things they could say not aloud I could hear, 
And the thoughts I could not utter they knew. 
Ill things they murmured, hut some were gentle, 
And some lied still, but some could speak true. 

The proud and the great were as the evil 
Lonely alike in silentness 
And any friendly thought that brushed them 
Eased them in their loneliness. 

Now even their images are dissolved, 
The crowds that passed them and I that stayed 
Are gone, and their own presences perished; 
And I that lived on awhile, afraid, 

With dreams that brought them staring at me, 
As they had stared down year after year, 
I also sickened as if they drew me 
Down to this dark. And I died of fear." 

" Enough, Bartholomew, your talk grows morbid; 
Shake off your melancholy, hush that sigh. 
There's a music, listen!" 

" 'Tis that thin piping 
Sharpens the thoughts that will not die."

WOMAN AND PROFESSOR 

HE stood and pointed with scorn at a Bond Street 

window, 

A quaint, dry figure in that delectable place. 
"All this finery," he said, "all these fripperies, all 

these gewgaws 
Isn't it a disgrace 
That a woman should spend money as if it were 

water 
To deck her body and her face?" 

"And yet," I said, "but for some pre-historic creature 
Adjusting the folds of her garment with purpose- 
ful care 
Or spending the long hours twisting this way and 

that way 

The strands of her hair, 
Possibly neither great London, nor you, friend 

Professor, 
Nor I, might be there."

VILLAGES 

THE inland villages are fair; 

Above their roads the high trees meet 
And shelter houses white and square 

That front a quiet street. 

And folk are there whose one desire 

Is in all fellowship to dwell; 
And there's a white church with a spire, 

And doves about its bell. 

And there are food and hearth and chair 

For any traveler who asks, 
And gentle maids with banded hair 

Go softly on their tasks. 

But villages beside the sea 

Are rough as wind and fierce as light, 
And brown-skinned girls dance wild and free 

When fiddles play at night. 

And love and death have equal rates, 
And men are strong and loud of speech, 

And make a housing for their mates 
From wrecks that strew the beach* 

In inland villages they grow 

The herb called heartsease would that we 
Might find it there who long ago 

Turned hawk-like to the sea.

WET NIGHT 

Now that the evening shuts with rain, 

And early creeps the pallid light 

Unmourned from fields of sodden grain, 

And in untimely night 

The brave confusion of my flowers 

Is quenched, I sit as lovers will 

Who gaze at loss through timeless hours. 

Cold is my heart, and still. 

But it was hot vith pity when 

At noonday from window high 

I watched black weather from the west 

Steal on a summer sky. 

0, it was torn with sadness then 

To feel light dimmed, sweet air forlorn 

With change, and gusty dark unrest 

Fever the deep-breath'd morn. 

For soon the wing of heaven was crushed 

With inky smudges on its bloom, 

And wildflowers deep in meadows hushed 

Shivered against the gloom; 

And water's lustrous limbs fell still, 

Bright shadows to one sick shade grew, 

And, as I watched, each dreaming hill 

Woke, a tense watcher too. 

84 



Then ran a shudder through the air, 
And harassed winds began to sigh 
And tear the ashen tree-tops where 
Dark storm rags whipped the sky. 
And when at last from window high 
I turned with dragging steps away, 
My heart was dark with pain, for I 
Had seen grow sick, and pale, and die 
The beauty of a day.

FROM DISCIPLE TO MASTER 

(To A. E.) 

MY life is like a dream, 
I do not know 
How it began, nor yet 
How it will go. 

Out of the night a bird 
Has quickly flown 
Across the lighted room. 
And now is gone 

Into the dark again 
From whence it came 
So the old druids said, 
And I the same. 

But we are not content, 
I, like them too, 
Questioning all I meet 
Seek something new. 

Saying to each who comes, 
"So much is clear, 
But, if you know of more 
I wait to hear. 

"The dark, the lighted room, 
The bird which flies 
86 



Are not enough for man 
Who one day dies. 

"Are not enough for man, 
That bird which came 
Out of the dark and must 
Return again. 

"If you know more besides, 
Tell what you know, 
O wise and travelled souls, 
Before I go."

THE HOUSE 

PRESENTLY when the stir 
Dies in the little street. 
When I no longer heed 
Chatter or passing feet; 

When I have learnt to use 
Window and door and bolt, 
How to outwit the knave 
How to expel the dolt; 

No longer mocked by lies 
No longer prey to fool, 
No longer tyrannised, 
I shall begin to rule. 

Too much confusion now, 
Too wild a discontent, 
Too many voices heard, 
Servants grown insolent: 

Time to assert the will, 
Time to make clear my choice, 
Time to begin to speak 
With a more certain voice: 

Ordered at last throughout, 
Ridden of bat and mouse. 
Presently I shall be 
Master in my own house.

THE GOLDEN ROOM 

Do you remember the still summer evening 
When in the cosy cream-washed living-room 
Of the Old Nailshop we all talked and laughed 
Our neighbors from the Gallows, Catherine 
And Lascelles Abercrombie; Rupert Brooke; 
Eleanor and Robert Frost, living awhile 
At Little Iddens, who'd brought over with them 
Helen and Edward Thomas? In the lamplight 
We talked and laughed, but for the most part 

listened 

While Robert Frost kept on and on and on 
In his slow New England fashion for our delight, 
Holding us with shrewd turns and racy quips, 
And the rare twinkle of his grave blue eyes. 

We sat there in the lamplight while the day 
Died from rose-latticed casements, and the plovers 
Called over the low meadows till the owls 
Answered them from the elms ; we sat and talked 
Now a quick flash from Abercrombie, now 
A murmured dry half -heard aside from Thomas, 
Now a clear laughing word from Brooke, and then 
Again Frost's rich and ripe philosophy 
That had the body and tang of good draught-cider 
And poured as clear a stream. 

'T was in July 

Of nineteen-fourteen that we sat and talked; 
Then August brought the war, and scattered us. 
89 



Now on the crest of an -Sgean Isle 

Brooke sleeps and dreams of England. Thomas 

lies 

'Neath Vimy Ridge where he among his fellows 
Died just as life had touched his lips to song. 

And nigh as ruthlessly has life divided 

Us who survive, for Abercrombie toils 

In a black Northern town beneath the glower 

Of hanging smoke, and in America 

Frost farms once more, and far from the Old 

Nailshop 
We sojourn by the Western sea. 

And yet 

Was it for nothing that the little room 
All golden in the lamplight thrilled with golden 
Laughter from hearts of friends that summer night? 
Darkness has fallen on it, and the shadow 
May never more be lifted from the hearts 
That went through those black years of death, and 

live. 

And still, whenever men and women gather 
For talk and laughter on a summer night, 
Shall not that lamp rekindle, and the room 
Glow once again alive with light and laughter, 
And like a singing star in time's abyss 
Burn golden-hearted through oblivion? 

WILFRID GIBSON.

FRAIL STRENGTH 

As bits of lichen or of weed, 

By drawing moisture and the dew, 

Will slowly dig their fingers in 
And slowly split a rock in two, 

My songs at length will drink up strength, 
And like frail fingers of the fern 

Upon the world's hard rock, will crack 
The houlder of its unconcern.

THE MISTRESS OF THE INN 

WHAT, does one spread the table for a stranger 
Before he's showed his passport, signed his name? 
A harbor-town like this, we're all in danger 
Of being left with the sack. I ruled the same 
For all comers they'll remember how I said it: 
First, if you please., the color of my pay? 
To you, you only, I'd have given credit; 
You could have chalked the slate and sailed away. 

You who, entering, halted, let your quick glance 
scan 

The place, tossed a scornful sixpence to the 
porter. . . . 

No ships, these days. . . . That tight-fisted harri- 
dan, 

Life, might at least give back as good as I've 
brought her 

I who watch above a waste of gray-green water 

The flappings of a mateless pelican.

PORTRAIT 
JANE W. . . . 

SHE does not seem to care. 
She does not know her hair 
Is golden with a hint 
Of Trojan ashes in't. 
She does not seem to know 
How rarely dark eyes go 
With honey-coloured hairs 
Drowning the coral ears. 

She does not know her worth. 
She thinks that Love is mirth. 
And laughs; I never saw 
Beauty more free from awe. 
What could she do but choose 
Her body young and loose, 
Her calm and easy ways 
And that wide and level gaze? 
And maybe in that dress 
Add to her loveliness. 

The Past was mine but O 
With this unmelted snow 
America has caught 
The eye of all my thought: 
Helen, your foster town 
Once and for all is down, 
93 



And now Grand Rapids race 
To take Scamander's place, 
Araby the Blest 
Loses the Phoenix nest! 

And now, and now 
My song shall tell but how? 
Can poetry compose 
The budding of a rose, 
Or prosody out-do 
The throstle in the yew, 
Or memory make up 
For Life and love and hope? 
Before her living word 
My singing is absurd: 
"You have my hand," she said, 
"Where shall I put my head?"

AS WELL AS ANY OTHER 

As well as any other, Erato, 

I can dwell separately on what men know 

In common secrecy 

And celebrate the old adored rose, 

Re-tell oh, why how similarly grows 

The last leaf of the tree. 

But for familiar sense what need can be 
Of my most singular survey or me 
If homage may be done 
(Unless it is agreed we shall not break 
The patent silence just for singing's sake) 
As well by anyone? 

Reject me not, then, if I have begun 
Unwontedly or if I seem to shun 
The close and well-tilled ground* 
For in untraveled soil alone can I 
Unearth the gem or let the mystery lie 
That never must be found.

MANY GENTLEMEN 

MANY gentlemen there are born not babes. 

They will be babes, they will be babes 

In the shades. 

They will dribble, they will babble, 

They will pule in pantomime 

Who were not babes in baby time. 

Of such infant sorrow 

Will they whimper 

On Aspasia's bosom 

In the shades tomorrow: 

Many gentlemen, many gentlemen frowning, 

But not Socrates simpering among these, 

Who was well weaned of her honey 

In his prime and needs no pap now, 

Having long ago with baby eyes 

Smiled upward to her learned brow.

MY PROUD DARK-EYED SAILOR 

(To the air of "Castle O'Neill! 9 ) 

MY brave boy is far from me, 

Oh, my sorrow, on a strange, distant shore 
My proud, dark-eyed sailor, 

When shall I see him once more? 
With heart near to the breaking, 

In the harvest field lonesome I bind. 
It is alone I'm hay-making, 

When each girl has her boy close and kind. 

Ah, heavy the steps I take, 

As to Chapel on the Sunday I walk. 
Since he's not to meet me, 

With his fond looks and low, tender talk; 
While my rose-tree richly flowering, 

Whose blossom he plucked for my breast, 
Its petals sadly is showering, 

At the long, bitter blast from the West. 

But deep down within my heart, 

There's a dear hope we'll be meeting next spring, 
My proud, dark-eyed sailor! 

And our marriage bells sweetly shall ring; 
Till beside you walking, high-headed, 

Under Castle O'Neill's shining towers, 
Upon your arm, when we're wedded, 

We'll pass through a pelting of flowers.

THE CORNER-KNOT 

I WAS a child and overwhelmed: Mozart 

Had snatched me up fainting and wild at heart 

To a green land of wonder, where estranged 

I dipped my feet in shallow brooks, I ranged 

Rough mountains and fields yellow with small 

vetch 

Of which though long I tried I could not fetch 
One single flower away, nor from the ground 
Pocket one pebhle of the scores I found 
Twinkling enchanted there. So for relief 
"I'll corner-knot," said I, "this handkerchief 
Faithful familiar that I hold or shake 
In these cool airs for proof that I'm awake." 
I lied the knot: the aspens all around 
Shook and the river-reeds were filled with sound; 
Which failing presently, the insistent loud 
Clapping of hands returned me to the crowd. 
I felt and fumbling took away with me 
The knotted witness of my ecstasy: 
But flowers and streams were vanished past recall, 
The aspens, the sad singing reeds and all. 

Vanished: but that was twenty years ago. 
Now again listening to Mozart I know 
What then I never guessed that he, Mozart 
Himself, had been snatched up by curious art 
To my green land: estranged and wild at heart 
He too had crossed the brooks, essayed to pick 
98 



That yellow vetch with which the plains are thick. 

And being put to it, as I had been 

To smuggle back some witness of the scene, 

Had knotted up his broad silk handkerchief 

In common music, rippling flat and brief, 

And home again, had sighed above the score, 

"Yes, a remembrancer but nothing more." 

Oh most mistaken, for that faithful knot 

Once charged to witness how and where and what, 

Though in itself a dumb and idle thing 

Will yet by art again contrive to bring 

Convoys of novices to that green land : 

They gasp and stare and quite dumb-founded stand.

OLD CHRISTMAS MORNING 
A Kentucky Mountain Ballad 

"WHERE you coming from, Lomey Carter, 

So airly over the snow? 

And what's them pretties you got in your hand, 
And where you aiming to go? 

"Step in, Honey: Old Christmas morning 

I ain't got nothing much; 
Maybe a bite of sweetness and corn bread, 
A little ham meat and such. 

"But come in, Honey! Sally Anne Barton's 

Hungering after your face. 
Wait till I light my candle up: 

Set down! There's your old place. 

"Now where you been so airly this morning?" 

"Graveyard, Sally Anne. 
Up by the trace in the salt lick meadows 
Where Taulbe kilt my man." 

"Taulbe ain't to home this morning . . 

I can't scratch up a light: 
Dampness gets on the heads of the matches; 
But I'll blow up the embers bright." 
101 



"Needn't trouble. I won't be stopping: 

Going a long ways still," 
"You didn't see nothing, Lomey Carter, 

Up on the graveyard hill?" 

"What should I see there, Sally Anne Barton?" 

"Well, sperits do walk last night." 
"There were an elder bush a-hlooming 
While the moon still give some light." 

"Yes, elder bushes, they bloom, Old Christmas, 

And critters kneel down in their straw. 
Anything else up in the graveyard?" 
"One thing more I saw: 

"I saw my man with his head all bleeding 

Where Taulbe's shot went through." 
"What did he say?" "He stooped and kissed me," 
"What did he say to you?" 

"Said, Lord Jesus forguv your Taulbe; 

But he told me another word; 
He said it soft when he stooped and kissed me. 
That were the last I heard." 



"Taulbe ain't to home this morning." 
"I know that, Sally Anne, 

For I kilt him, coming down through the meadow 
Where Taulbe kilt my man, 
102 



"I met him up on the meadow trace 

When the moon were fainting fast, 
And I had my dead man's rifle gun 
And kilt him as he come past." 

"But I heard two shots." " 'Twas his was second: 

He shot me 'fore he died: 
You'll find us at daybreak, Sally Anne Barton: 
I'm laying there dead at his side." 

ROY HELTON.

THE DARK BREED 

WITH those bawneen men I'm one, 

In the grey dusk-fall, 
Watching the Galway land 

Sink down in distress 
With dark men, talking of grass, 

By a loose stone wall, 
In murmurs drifting and drifting 

To loneliness. 

Over this loneliness, 

Wild riders gather their fill 

Of talking on beasts and on fields 
Too lean for a plough, 

Until more grey than the grey air, 
Song drips from a still, 

Through poteen, reeling the dancing- 
Ebbing the grief now! 

Just, bred from the cold lean rock, 

Those fellows have grown; 
And only in that grey fire 

Their lonely days pass 
To dreams of far clovers 

And cream-gathering heifers, alone 
Under the hazels of moon-lighters, 

Clearing the grass. 

104 



Again in the darkness, 

Dull knives we may secretly grease, 
And talk of blown horns on clovers 

Where graziers have lain; 
But there rolls the mist 

With sails pulling wind from the seas 
No bullion can brighten that mist, 

O brood of lost Spain. 

So we, with the last dark men, 

Left on the rock grass, 
May brazen grey loneliness 

Over a poteen still 
Or crowd on the bare chapel floor 

Hearing the Mass, 
To loosen that hunger 

Broken land never can fill.

LET US CONSTRUCT A GOD 

IT would be pleasant to believe that you, 

My sweet, and I, 

And all things near to us 

Other men's bodies, earth, the floating blue 

Slope of the sky, 

Soft worms ravenous 

And eager in the dark, white whirling snow, 

Crisp insects, grass, 

And the glistering air 

Are tenuous semblances that waken, glow. 

Sparkle, or pass 

In mist away, or reappear 

Again in the swift thought of some one Being; 

That we are crystal phantoms 

Fluttering in a room 

Whose walls are too strange, too distant for our 

seeing. 

. . . And thus the anthems 
We chanted in the gentle gloom 

Of churches, are but echoes of an echoing. 
All our wise books 
And beads and worshipping 
Are but reflections twice reflected of a Thing 
That thinking, looks 

Into a well of space, a glittering spring, 
106 



And wills the image of Its thought perfect, un- 
wavering. 

Sweet, it would be good so to believe, for then 

All things near to us 

That we have seen or dreamed 

Or half forgot beasts, dying men, 

Slow stars, and rust, 

Frost that has gleamed 

Through the low-bending night on a black-stemmed 
bush 

All these would grow 

Together in a warm communion. 

For would not the level sea with its windless hush 

And your voice and my voice know 

Each other as kindred echoes in the mind of One 

That shadows Itself alike in clouds and in moun- 
tains of stone?

TO GRAMMAR 

DAUGHTER of Alexandrian pedantry, 
Mysterious descendant of the Sphinx, 
Born to confuse the honest mind that thinks 
To probe the hidden deeps of history 
And overpass the perils of the sea 

Of alien languages; the swimmer sinks 

In thy cross-currents. Grammar, and he drinks 
Deep of the salt brine of perplexity. 
Ah, happy he who scorns thy fettering rules, 

Who dares to wander through the realms of 

speech 
Untrammelled by traditions of the schools; 

Who, like the wave that dashes on the beach, 
Moves on majestic, nor regards the fools 

Who crush with petty laws the minds they seek 
to teach.

HOMO ADDITUS NATURAE 

OH, my young fellow, innocently going 

Across earth's colored acres, stride by stride, 
Wrapped in your cloak of mood, and gaily showing 

A scarf of modern thought, too bright to hide, 
Under the trees, and over water flowing, 

You pass with roaming eyes, preoccupied 
With what you wear, aloof to stones, unknowing 

The pull and power working at your side. 

Some day a ragged, curious old man 
Will come and sun his reminiscent bones, 

Hungry to keep what permanence he can, 
The potent trees, the dull magnetic stones, 

Still unaware how cunningly they drew 

Him into them, long since, when he was you.

LINES ON GROWING OLD 

SIMEON to Mary : "Yea, 

A sword shall pierce thine heart." 

So saint to saint; we have another way 

With swords to pierce the heart. 

Rahbi Ben Ezra dogmas in the hand, 

Hack we the hlade-edge privily first, then stand 

Shod with evasion for the strife to start. 

So I perceive myself meet age 
Tossing a night or two with the surprise 
Of puckered weariness around the eyes 
That does not pass; but speedily the stage 
Of placing character in scars and lines 
Above the surface perfectness of youth. "Signs 
Of some suffering, a little thought," says she, 
Into a mirror, held not quite so near. 
Then for a palate altered there will he 
Almost no need of recompense. 
For who endowed with self -preserving sense 
Would shed one tear 

For having lost fastidiousness, and substituted 
For lust of life importunate that looted 
Realm after realm and found their wealth to fail, 
A Hedonism built on humbler scale? 
Love is, 'tis true (I hear old age debate), 
A most absorbing form of sport, 
But, if my memory does not distort, 
Its painfulness would rule it out of court 
110 



In any well-conducted State. 

At that, one hope alone there might be left, 

That I should feel the blade-point through a cleft 

In all this plate and mail of cowardice; 

The sick glance on me of a dancing miss, 

Pitying not loathing the self -to-be. 

Unless I should know better than to see. 

LYN LLOYD IRVINE. 



Ill 



EROS 

I SEE in your eyes what you have seen: 
Laughter and wonder and dark wet trees 
With the naked huds close clinging, 
And a wind that races with swift hare knees 
On the darkened earth and across the sheen 
Rippled and roughened and cold and gray, 
Shaken and trembling and clear ancT gray, 
Of the lake and the wild duck winging. 

I see in your eyes what you have seen: 

One gray drake and another gray drake 

And a young gray duck at the edge of the lake 

The cries and the splashing, the joy of the fight, 

And the sudden rhythm of three in flight. 

Low, high, in the cloudy sky. 

Low, high, curve and dip! 

She in the lead with taut neck steering, 

This way, that way, turning, veering. 

Low, high, curve and dip, 

And the echo of the exultant note 

That challenged her mate from her sure gray throat. 

Deep in your eyes what you have seen! 
The shaken water, the leafless trees, 
And the long gray flight that swept between 
Gray as the clouds a March wind flings 
From sky to sky, till above your head 
They dipped, and a glory of purple spread, 
112 



A flashing oval of purple spread. 

Like a sunlit sword, like a shout from the dead, 

Like the naked pulse of a new horn world, 

Like a hanner, suddenly unfurled 

From the secret silver under their wings. 

Low, high, curve and dip. 

Gray, were they gray? 

Suddenly into the lake they slip, 

The one half-hearted Backs away, 

The other turns into the wind and flow. 

Did she see, did she know? 

Purple and silver are hidden away, 

And he calls with a quiet protecting note, 

While she swims behind with her head held low. 

Ah, so chastened, so gray, so low, 

Low, low, 

And the ripples kissing her throat.

TAPESTRY 

THE night is paved with purple. Winds have torn 

The arras of the sunset and laid hare 

A waste of wintry stars, astonished there, 

And the recumbent moon's up-tilted horn. 

From windows of desire and guarded doors 

That open in this fortalice of dust 

We hear the sound of constant waters thrust 

Back from the ramparts of remoter shores. 

Like statues frozen in a niche we stand, 
Hearing the surf that beats through endless time 
On seacoasts even the sails of Argos passed. 
Here are all houses ever built on sand; 
False beacon and mirage, and bells that chime, 
Calling Ulysses, bound against the mast.

ASTROLOGY 

WITH half the glittering heavens on his back, 
He made a cheerful compromise with earth, 
Holding no grudge against the zodiac 
For having blazoned Virgo at his birth. 
Out of a sky no longer comet-crossed 
Or clogged with stars, he said, would come a sign; 
And while he waited Life might well be lost, 
Though all the kindlier planets were in trine. 

Choosing between the jewel and the toad, 
He somehow paltered, and we found a nook 
In Time and Space for his enforced abode, 
Growing accustomed to his absent look 
His anxiously apocalyptic air 
Of seeming to be neither here nor there.

REALITY 

DOWN the world, with feet of clay, 
Came the first man that first day; 
The first man in his stature whole, 
Out of his eyes there looked a soul. 

Out of his head and heart and arms 
Came brave motions, potent charms; 
He looked up and he looked round, 
He looked long upon the ground. 

Said the first man to the tree, 
"Today you have been given to me." 
Said the first man to the sky, 
"Strange, you are not very high." 

He swam the river, killed the beast, 
Struck out fire and made his feast; 
His pillow and his roof were rock, 
He shaped dirt for a drinking crock. 

Arrows from the sapling came 
And flew until the world was tame. 
The first man mocked the morning sun, 
"Look," he cried, "what I have done! 

"I make the grain grow for my bread, 
I make the leaves grow for my bed; 
I am a king most certainly, 
I am king of all I see!" 
116 



Then the light upon the hill 
Went out; the sullen air was still. 
The darkness grew too thick for breath, 
And a voice said, "This is death." 

The stillness ended at the sound; 
The trees lashed wildly and the ground 
Shook till the first man could not stand; 
He lay and shook upon the land. 

He heard the waters pound the shore, 
The rivers hroke their banks and tore 
Rocks like rafts from their solid base; 
The first man bowed his coward face. 

Terrible and more terrible still 
Shrieked the wind from hill to hill. 
Endless seemed that devil's strife, 
Then a voice said, "This is life." 

The wind went down, a star returned, 
Green, then red, the East-rim burned; 
The sky, the earth, his sight were strange, 
All about was wreck and change. 

The first man raised his stricken head, 
He knew not yet if he was dead; 
He felt his heart beat with his hand, 
He touched the hard, subsiding land. 

117 



Out of the flying mist he saw 
Green and red on dew and shaw 
Green and red and he were one. 
And the first man thanked the sun. 

Suddenly, oh suddenly, 

The light came back on range and tree, 

Joyous tree and dewy range 

The first man wondered at the change. 

Suddenly, oh suddenly, 
The first man saw reality. 
Life and death and he were one 
With the violence of the sun.

INTERIOR 

I WONDERED if I were a chair myself, 
Or perhaps just a serape 
Thrown down carelessly, 
Dragging on the floor. 

I wasn't thinking, only sitting, 

And there seemed no difference 

Between me and the table. 

Except that the table had four legs 

Browner than my two, 

And the table's face 

Reflected the light 

More vividly than mine. 

The little carving on the wooden stand 

Was more beautiful than I am, 

And the painting on the wall 

Was more alive ? 

And the book beside me 

Was more intelligent, 

And the electric light brighter; 

And the pillow, and the piano, 

And the paper-weight, 

And the flowers in the vase, 

And the rugs 

Everything was more something. 

Surely the curtains at the window 

Can see the moon rise, 

And an automobile 

119 



With green eyelids 
Come up the street, 
And Mars approaching 
With a bloody twinkle. 

Surely the piano can remember 
The girl with auburn hair 
Who played the tune she said 
Was popular in St. Louis. 
And what chair could forget 
That a fat man sat upon it 
Through an evening? 

Yes, I must he a chair, 
Or a serape, or a rug. 
I seem to remember 
The nail the carpenter used 
To mend my broken arm; 
And I can recall the hollow shock 
Each time the weaver 
Put his foot upon the pedal 
Of his loom repairing me. 
But at the same time 
I feel the pleasant thrill 
Of a girl shaking me 
In the sunlight. 
And all the while I know 
That I am nothing in the room 
But all of it; 

That I am here not only now 
120 



But have always been here. 

I am confused and timeless: 

Is this a pelado's poor adobe, 

Or has an artist 

Remodelled it into a studio? 

Do I see a barren cot 

In that corner instead of cushions and a couch? 

Or is this tomorrow 

Instead of yesterday? 

I seem to have sat here a hundred years, 
Waiting for an explanation of it all. 
And yet I came in only an hour ago 
To sit quietly 
And to be alone . . .

THE CRANE IN BLOOMSBURY 

MAN'S god to see, backwards I bent my head, 
Like any saint intent upon his vision. 
There, dark against the clouds, the monster raised 
Colossal arms, and moved with slow decision 
Half over heaven. Yet no one seemed amazed, 
No one fell prostrate, worshiping his power; 
But midget men, commanding, while I gazed 
Moved their weak arms, and brought the god's arms 
lower. 

Roared all around me motor evidence 

Of our assault upon life's brevity: 

Men hurried as though death were at their heels, 

And would not leave their thoughts alone, lest he 

Should gain upon them. So they rushed on wheels 

From door to door, filling the moments out 

With twice each moment's labor though there 

steals 
Only behind more haste a heavier doubt. 

And from the ground an exhalation came, 
Even in the breath of stone and iron streets, 
The breath of Autumn, earthy from the leaves 
Fallen beneath the trees such breath as meets 
An idle harvester when all the sheaves 



122 



Are carried, or some ploughboy wandering home, 
Who, missing the late swallow from his eaves, 
In darkening silence listens, and is dumb. 

FRANK KENDON.

TOBACCO SMOKE 

THIS time I've sent her off on a French steamer, 

The kind to lull awhile a helpless dreamer; 

Cushioned with idleness, action a slave 

To what the ether wills, or what the wave; 

Quite lively too and furnished with narcotics, 

The hits of novelty that soothe neurotics 

Against the scourge that whips and drives them 

frantic : 

This phantom life of hers, blindly romantic, 
Pursuing and pursued by one affection 
Of endless and of hopeless introspection. 

A childish game of hide and seek grown tragic, 
A looking glass distorting her with magic: 
The one that shuts her off from seeing me, 
The one that holds my love from freeing me 
Of each and every effort every day 
To play for her the peerless popinjay. 
A man can't go on swinging like an ape, 
Gyrate to dizzy breezes, change his shape, 
And counterfeit all lovers if he can, 
Each one a variation and a man. 

You think there's nothing in this, and you smile? 
You'd better fill your pipe again and I'll 
Set up a final hurdle to beguile 
Your humor make it jump a broader stile. 
Fm muddled, so you'll have to help me through 
By listening the way you always do. 
124 



I saw her off last night. Do you suppose 

She had some stray affection to disclose? 

No, something had to tantalize her mind 

I must be sure not to forget, a kind 

Of final errand she'd not had a chance 

To attend to "There's a dear, while I'm in 

France" 

And there's the mischief too, for she'll repine 
If I'm remiss ; she'll be the one to whine 
And whimper not to a fellow like you; 
She doesn't need a soul to see her through 
So long as she has me to be them all : 
Husband and friend, lover and man, in thrall, 
Each variation tenderly the tool 
For that hurt little heart of hers to rule. 
A dear quaint letter, daintily contrived, 
Will question what it was could have connived 
With me; or was her "one last small request 
So small I must have thought it but a jest?" 
Bantering and cajoling me, her scrawl 
Makes all the dupe return and busily crawl 
Back to her feet; and though I know by heart 
Her sleight of hand, so obvious the art. 
Like some short-sighted youth I read her letter 
And run and get the thing she wants, and better. 

I won't say that she's conscious I'm a fool; 
Nor is she calculating as a rule; 
She's much too innocent to be considerate 
I'd never move an inch were she deliberate. 
125 



One can't help feeling it's a deep, chronic 
Disease that keeps her helplessness despotic; 
And probe or wait for the least hopeful sign 
Hinting a cure (with other hands than mine) . 

When I first saw the girl, she was a child; 
One couldn't court her then, one used a mild 
Wakeful prayerful sort of watchfulness 
Composed of one long fatherly caress: 
One used it then, one used it later; now, 
Abuse has made the habit stay somehow. 
The fault, you see, is mine, for I have toiled 
To spoil the child in her and keep her spoiled 
By letting her depend her independence 
On me, without the need of some repentance 
To nurture sudden traits of conscience in her. 
Now might not one assume that I'm the sinner? 

And one might ask: "What can it be you're losing, 
Since what you haven't got is your own choosing, 
And what you still might find you throw away 
By putting it on the wind to blow away? 
Though you put her there before, and she returned, 
What did you gain thereby, what have you learned? 
You were so glad to have her near the fire, 
You even neglected wholly to inquire 
What had happened to her in this weird game. 
In fact, you found the woman quite the same 
After she saw you, greeted you and kissed you, 
Told you right off how terribly she'd missed you. 
126 



She did, with being constantly in trouble, 
Bursting against discomfort like a bubble, 
Not knowing where to turn or how to land, 
And growing paler longing for a hand 
Not one of theirs, but one of yours to come 
And lift her gently down again and home. 
If she should meet a man this time, a lover, 
Do you believe you two would then recover?" 

No need to try that, she tried that before: 
They dallied about, were queer and came no more 
Queer was the word she used against them all. 
Clearly they must have seen about them crawl 
The ghosts of me in each of my disguises, 
The sight of which unmasked her of surprises. 
The girl in her expected the quintessence 
Of what she'd always had my adolescence. 
Foreigners raised their brows, politely quit, 
And later doubtless spiced their tales with wit. 
In season, she'll come back across the puddle 
And wave to me to wade out to the muddle, 
Wherein I'm quite immersed as soon as she 
Is close enough for me once more to see 
We cannot live without each other far, 
Nor even exist with both of us too near. 
And so I let her let me send her off, 
And grope alone for ways to mend our love. 

I might see what to do if I were clearer, 
If I were not so everlasting near her. 
127 



I'm talkative now, but when I want a word 

To touch her presence, turn her around absurd 

How I dodder along, procrastinate 

And lose the moment in a silent fate. 

A playful approach would do, an indirect 

Method of teasing her to be circumspect. 

Alas, one might as well address a cloud; 

She is just as remote from earth, as proud 

And sensitive so easy to dissolve, 

I have to stay below with my resolve. 

She has a way, when trouble's in the air, 

Of trembling, concentrating in a stare, 

Huddling together, crumbling in my arm, 

Where there's a cloud to shield the cloud from 

harm. 

She's made of tiny fibres, nerves and veins 
Too small to see but large enough for rains. 

I might see what to do if it were smoke, 
If I could watch it leave our pipes, a joke 
So long as I have you to smile at it, 
And shake your tranquil head a while at it. 
But when I have to leave this room behind 
And trek back to the rooms no longer kind, 
And find familiar things familiarly 
In places where she left them, each one the 
Remainder and reminder, then my head 
Is little use to me except in bed. 
And even there, there's no real compensation, 
Never a glimpse of healing revelation. 
128 



The malady I have feels ages deep 
No remedy can cure, not even sleep. 

Some morning when I wake and think I'm dead 

I'm sure I'll be alive and still in bed. 

One would suspect some night I might retreat 

Behind a measure that could bring defeat 

To the boomerang that haunts me like a thief. 

I might attempt it if it brought relief 

To her as well as me. But while there's doubt 

Of that, and knowledge she can't do without 

What I am to her, and a hope I'll be still more 

Accompanying her when she comes in the door 

With that trouble in her eyes I can't evade 

Like a thing seeking protection in the shade 

It cannot see its way about in why, 

There we are again, and there am I, 

Too much afraid for her to be afraid 

Of anything else: and thus life goes ahead. 

You grin at this? And I can feel a smile 
Begin to creep. And so good night a while. 

AUFRED KREYMBORG,

BLINDMAN 

I IHEARD one praise his love 
In a voice that shook 

With passionate exaltation of 
Her brow and look. 

Dull to my sight, to my heart, 
I saw his love pass by; 

Nor knew if he were blind 
Or I.

PASSER-BY 

HE jostled through the crowded train, 

So grey of face, 
One glance showed death was following him 

Swift pace for pace. 

Oh, Sun, be quick! shine on him now! 

Be warm! be kind! 
Another week you'll search for him 

Search, and not find,

"IT IS THE TRUE STAR" 

I WILL remember this night. So long as mind 
Endures to captain against the vandal Doom 
Her forlorn hopes nerve, blood and bone de- 
signed 
After death's image, let me remember this night. 

There were daffodils at one corner of my room 
Poised in a golden trance, and the four white- 
Panelled walls made cosmos in miniature 
Serene as a dewdrop or a Chinese poem, 
And I its essence and demiurge. So pure 
A oneness (I thought) is every man. No stir 
From the street breaks on his Self, a play without 

proem 

Or epilogue, dreamed in the theatre 
He calls his life; being actor and audience 
To the last posture of decay he claps, 
Hisses yawns at himself. 
But then, what sense 

Have they the pioneer-minded, the rebel -hearted, 
If a man's fulfilment rest on no "perhaps" 
Outside him? They are bell-buoys adrift from 

their charted 

Safe shallows, sagging inanely through a sea 
That yerks them up to meaningless stars, clanging, 
Clanging for Eldorado, dementedly. 
Monad or Nomad? What difference, since either 
state 

132 



Binds us with a law, each soul from each estrang- 
ing* 
To be thus terribly masters of our fate? 

And I was sickened by this philosophy 
That would benight each man in a six-foot cell, 
Proud Playboy of his own complacency. 
So I opened the window and put out my head, 
Thought's fog, portentous pachyderm, to dispel. 
("The monad has no windows," Leibnitz said.) 

Firm stood the moon, and all the sky marched on 
Rank after rank of cloud in ragged battalions 
Before its face: as though Napoleon, 
The squat dynamic man, straddling the snow 
Watched while his glorious tatterdemalions 
Trailed home and left his hope-blood at Moscow. 
Then, lapped in that magnificence, I knew 
Suddenly how all creatures from one source 
Take breath and purpose, and again renew 
It with their greatness. How the very star 
That held Columbus to his homeric course 
Waned on the waters around St. Helena. 

"This star that constant is for our possession, 
Find we its gleam amid whatever skies 
In valour's dayspring or the dry noontide passion 
To probe beneath life's semblances, or drowned 
In the deep-sea midnight of a woman's eyes: 
This star, whose mere reflection will astound 
Us out of false content, by its possessing 
Mates every true possessor; and so fills 
133 



Each creature with Creation, itself amassing 
Frpn men the stuff of Godhead." . . . 

As I spoke, 

Quietly like a clump of daffodils 
Out of the night grew dawn, and sparrows awoke. 

CECIL DAY LEWIS.

AN ABANDONED TOW-PATH 

IN idle dalliance now it welcomes weeds 

Grasshoppers dance along its unused ways; 
A rainbow blur of flowers tells of seeds 

The wind had caught in care-free yesterdays. 
And resting close beside it, almost dry, 

A greenish ghost of what was once a stream 
Sags low within its muddy bed, as lie 

The broken things whose life is but a dream. 

In memory alone it suffers pain: 

Informal insect choirs and elfin brass 

Intone a dirge for all who wax and wane, 
A requiem for all who thrive and pass. 

Sometimes, beneath the moon, it wakes to see 
The rotted locks draw open noiselessly. 

ELIAS LIEBERMAN.

THE LAKE 

SHE lies among the mountains in a little place 

Roomy for her, and dreaming in green trees 

Presses her waters through a grassy wood* 

The soft sand bears her burden; in her dreams 

She sings to the sand a melody, thinking so 

To make a gift to it for its own labouring. 

Far beyond her knowledge in the wood 

Stand the grey pines that like a mountain move, 

Twisting the fresh wind in their mighty tops. 

And these untremblingly she pictures in her eyes. 

Even the unclad peaks that strike the tender sky, 

These also looks she on, 

And rippling a new laughter to the wind 

Holds them within her, these to share her sleep. 

Daylight and Air, she dreams, come willingly to he 

In a blue radiance like a weft of sky: 

So to the unconquered Sun looks up, 

Lifts all her fairy strength and takes his gold 

In an enchantment weaving in the gold 

To an eye of the bluest sea, to a new-born opal. 

This to eternity: 

Not in her dreams beyond the scented fields 
Where flow her waters in a stream through flowers- 
Net in her dreams the soft sand shallowing, 
The hard fields breaking to sharp darts of earth 
Thrust piteously far out upon a rocky wall 
Shapeless, unspacious, nipped between the land, 
136 



Torn like a wound between. 

Oh, not in her dream the little lake 

Sees such a rift of peace! 

Her waters bent in tumult and grey pines 

Scarring her tortured foam, and boulders torn 

Out of the rocky earth with insane action. 

Beating the long way through, beating the blind 

crushed gorge, 
Flung height to height, bruising her frail bright 

foam 

And no light there no light in its sweet time, 
No morning coming early, waxing into noon 
In secure pleasing order. 
Here dark is light, here day is dark, 
Here is no day, no moon, no stars, no sun. 
But thousand moons or thousand stars, or Sun 
Split monstrously. . . . 
Oh, not in her dreams the little lake 
Sees this her darkness ! 
Nor yet upon a night when on her shines 
The small moon loving her, sees she in any dream 
Her waters strong and stronger, 
All her wide tide stronger, 
Thrusting the rough pines under, 
Riding the mute earth over 
Smooth as a storm when its thunder 
Is dumb, is not voiced, but keeping 
Till the dark cracks asunder. 
Oh, stilly she rides, and rides over! 
Brooding the grey rocks stand up amazed, 
137 



Cut with a sword, with a sword up-raised. 
Glitters the black of her passing, the Sun 
Strains his gold beams on the earth far over, 
Bids it fall back, make a path; ever stronger 
Comes her long pitiless tide . . . and after 
Daylight and Air have played with her sing 
Of the strength of her coming, and merrily bring 
New garlands of green on their wings: 
New garlands of green for the River, 
Praising, obeying the River!

IN A POWDER CLOSET 
(Early Eighteenth Century) 

MY very excellent young person, 

Since Fate has destined you to play the role of 
coiffeur, 

You will permit that I admire your quite unsur- 
passed skill, 

Together with your polished, if a trifle over- 
pronounced, manners, 

Without by an inch lessening the distance 

Which the hazard of birth and the artifice of custom 

Have placed between us. 

My mirror tells me that you are a personable man; 

But, indeed, it is my own image in this same mirror 

Which most occupies my attention. 

That such a subject as I offer 

Engages you to put forth your best efforts 

Is only natural; 

That I should remain indifferent is equally so. 

Be satisfied that the exigencies of your profession 

Admit you to privileges from which a more exalted 
station would exclude you. 

My maid will, I am sure, be most happy to accom- 
modate herself to your wishes, 

She is a worthy girl and entertains a not unjusti- 
fiable belief in my continued recognition of 
her services. 

The spray of heliotrope is well placed. 
139 



Do you think a patch just here at the corner of 

the eye? 

Ah, yes. It adds perceptibly. 
You are, Sir, a consummate artist. 
To-morrow at four I shall expect you. 

AMY LOWELL.

TOWARD A ROMANTIC REVIVAL 

WE too, we too descending once again 

The hills of our own land, we too have heard 

Far off Ah que ce cor a longue haleine 

The horn of Roland in the passages of Spain, 

The first, the second hlast, the failing third, 

And with the third turned back and climbed once 

more 

The steep road southward, and heard faint the sound 
Of swords, of horses, the disastrous war, 
And crossed the dark defile at last, and found 
At Rongevaux, upon the darkening plain 
The dead against the dead and on the silent ground 
The silent slain.

ELEVEN SAVED 

THE saved came from the surf like men new born, 
Crawling and staggering, their clothes in strips, 
Their eyes agape with fear, their bodies torn, 
With blood and sea- weed dark about their lips. 

But when they reached the inn they wrung their 

coats. 

Grinned each at other for their sad array; 
And coughed and spat the water from their throats, 
As though they spat the adventure clean away.

CAPE ST. VINCENT 
February 14th, 1797. 

BARELY twenty sail 

And a lawless crew at that, 
(Might have graced a yardarm at the Nore) 
Chanced it in a gale, 

And they laid the Dons out flat, 
Made a fine old shambles of some thirty 

Ships or more. 

Men with ready lips 

For a hottle or a wench, 
Swift to strike and follow up the blow; 
Big or little ships, 

To the Spanish or the French 
Hell could not have bettered them a 

Hundred years ago. 

What a mint of stuff 

You can press from any street, 
Fit and fresh for any brawl or breeze, 
Battle-bred and tough 

For the making of a fleet, 
Such a fleet as Jervis took to tidy up 

The seas !

On Contentment 

FIRST wife dead, second wife gone to China. 
No children, no house, only these little rooms, 
This stove, couch, bowl and spoon and image of

But a little silver laid away, and food enough ; 
Mind at rest, or filled with good thoughts, 
And long talks with Yang Chung every day.

FOR INSTANCE 

Vegetables 

and jewelry, rightly displayed, 

have an equal amount of fascination. 

Carrots, for instance, 

piled 

ferntops, bodies, and hair roots 

so bound together in bunches 

bunches laid in rows 

of oblong heaps with magnitude, 

are sufficient to arrest any seeing eye. 

Cabbages with a purplish tinge, 

when of grandeur, with widespread petals, 

as they rest in heaps 

catching the dawn's first filtering of sunlight, 

compare satisfyingly with roses enmassed, 

with orchids, sunflowers, tulips, 

or variegated flowers 

extravagantly scattered. 

While as to onions, 
little can excel their decorative effect 
when green tubes, white bulbs, and grey hair roots 
rest in well arranged, paralleled piles 
about which buxom women congregate, 
laughing and chattering in wholesome vulgarity. 
145 



Crispness, 

a cool indifference to the gash of knives, 

to the crush of kind, 

or to any destiny whatsoever, 

has granted the vegetables an arrogance of identity 

one would be foolhardy to strive after 

with heated impressionable imagination. 

Vegetables, 

given their color, 

scent and freshness, 

too easily attain a cool supremacy of being 

for our fumbling competition.

NO HOOVES, NO HORNS 

I WAS no devil, pray remember. 

Flesh of Adam was my disease. 
And we go always breaking our hearts, lady. 

The road is rugged in these countries. 

Pain came to you over my sorrow. 

I first traveled that thorny way. 
And other pilgrims are torn on the brambles, 

And we no more than they.

AND THE RIVERS RUN SOUTH 

RIVERS run south in America 
From the north, and the east, and the west. 
Always I must tell you of south-running valleys, 
Telling these, I give you my country. 

The Arkansas, James, Colorado, 
I give you my country exulting, 
I give you no couplets. 
Can you gather the storm in a raindrop, 
The night in a bird-shadow over the noon? 
Then neither can you fondle America, 
Tied and beribboned in a sonnet. 
Things held in the left hand, 
Measured with the right hand, 
Are things that are dead, 
And our country Ah God, how it lives! 
The joy of our rivers running south, 
Our river Mississippi, our broad-bosomed father, 
Searching and knowing 
The length and the span of our being! 

I remember looking out from our school, 
Looking down a long street with its elms, 
And the street went down to a river; 
I picked my first violets close to this river, 
I saw death the first time, by this river. 
I remember a plow taken down from a wagon, 
And the fields that began at our doorstep; 
148 



I would watch them turned over into a soft breath- 
ing darkness, 

Dark like the river that ran just beyond them; 
Then I would stand guard knowing pain for them, 
I would scream for intruders across them. 
For they were my own, my America; 
I was their lover, I and the river. 
And I would run over these fields in the night, 
Sinking down in the cool clinging blackness 
While the moon would look down at me stumbling, 
Lost in my prayers : 
"My country, my country." 
What squaws stooped along with me then, 
Up from the river, 
Their hands full of seeds, 
Mumbling "America"? 
What Braves slog-slogged at the fieldside, 
Slogged their foot and thigh rhythm, drum rhythm, 
Thumping "America"? 
I would fall, and my hands full of earth, 
I would run to the house and the fattening lilacs, 
The cherry trees waiting and the apples; 
There with the moonlight, the shadows, 
The music of the river within me, 
I would know my America. 

Everywhere, always, 
I go over rivers 

Down the night-trodden coolness of morning, 
149 



Yellow hands of the willows 
Bending the winter to April; 
Up the thin Autumn dusk, 
Dead leaves ticking 
The last thin breaths of October. 

I hear freights in the night 

Pushing the darkness 

Up hill and down hill, and over the rivers, 

Into stations of dawn. 

I know liners tied to wet wharves, 

Jostling America, 

My country suckling her harbors at the flow of her 

rivers, 

Holding her children, 
Holding tomorrow. 

Have you gone down the nights on the Mississippi 

River? 

Down the Missouri to the meeting of the waters? 
Down the Ohio? 
Missouri, Missouri, 

What sound and roar of south-pouring water, 
Snatching the Yellowstone up from Wyoming, 
And across Montana, down through the wheat. 
Ohio, Ohio, river running over, 
Black coal and iron: 
Mississippi, Father Mississippi, 
Side-wheeler, raft and canoe, 
Oh hug the plantation and hold the cotton, 
150 



Down the nights and down the days, 

Down our America 

Rock, and root, and blossom. 

Brown hills, thumbs of American mountains 
I see the wild geese flying over, 
Writing high the first letter of April, 
And I hear them again going back; 
The geese go north and the geese return, 
But always our rivers run south. 

Now I listen to axes in the night, 

(Who can hear axes at night without wincing?) 

I hear the trees going over, 

The fall of old years going down. 

I hear hammers in the night, 

Riveters' hammers, 

I see the quick tossing of flame, 

The weaving, the binding, and the growth. 

In May are the tulips, 

Slow loosening of petals from a center; 

And in May the top-story derricks 

Lift petals of stone up the mornings. 

And the rivers run south in America, 

Susquehanna, Savannah, 

Merrimac, Red, Alabama. 

A walking of many great people, my country, 
These men and these women, these lovers and 
children. 

151 



I see them by day in the fields 

With the sowing, the reaping, the building 

I see them at night in the cities, 

With the lights and the smoke blowing over the 

lights. 

In the morning they go, and the noon, 
Down the afternoon slant to the nights, 
While the statesmen stand in their park-niches. 
(Statesmen of stone and of bronze, 
Long ago did they lean over bridges and listen to 

the water, 
Water running south?) 

Oh listen, my country, to the rivers, 

Rivers telling of the rain, 

The rain at our roots, 

Our roots lying south with our rivers, 

The rain like our prayers, like our laughter, 

Molding yesterday's dust 

Into loam for more and more growing. 

Lean right or lean left, they always run south at the 
end; 

They tell you that nothing takes God in an unbend- 
ing line, 

Each tower, each prayer, 

Has its curves of remembering, its fear, and its 
laughter. 

Oh listen my country, 

While the rivers run south 

Do you hear them? 

152 



With my right hand, my left hand, 

I may give you the moon, I may give you the 

lilacs 

But always I give you America, 
My country, and her rivers running south. 

F. R. McCREARY.

REGATTA 

BEA.TTIE is finding life a perfect scream, on your 
right hand; 

And Mab is finding life a perfect scream, on your 
left hand. 

Beattie is tilting her round chin at you, provoca- 
tively; 

And Mab is tilting her round breasts at you, pro- 
vocatively. 

Life is a giggle for Mab ; 

And life is a giggle for Beattie; 

And both of them are convinced that life is a giggle 

For you. 

And you, whose eyes with so little stirring 

Could become two deep-moved pools of pain, 

You, young, and virgin, and virile, 

Unplumbable by Beattie, 

Unplumbable by Mab 

Will Beattie, ruffling the as yet calm surface of your 
boyish serenity, 

Capsize the rich and secret treasure that she will 
never envisage, 

Sinking it for ever in depths whose existence she 
will never guess? 

Or will it be Mab's dabbling fingers that will swamp 
your bright treasure-ship? 

Beautiful and vulnerable boy, 

Your beauty and your vulnerability 
154 



Stir me, impotent and aghast, 
With a wounding and unutterable 
Compassion. 



SUSAN MILES.

HOW BEAUTY CAME 

NOT through the massive sun- washed doors, 
Flung wide in the noisy house of the mind, 
To these and the newly varnished floors 
Her gypsy eyes were hlind. 

The heart that we rigged as a cloister-garden. 
With young wild flowers to feast her eyes, 
She passed, like a restless prison-warden 
When dusk on the cell-tier dies. 

The lighted towers of sense and sight 
Grew lonely straining for her face 
In vain, we borrowed music's might 
To lure her from her hiding place. 

But when each soul was scoured with flame, 
And every heart hy sorrow swept, 
Then, cold and naked, Beauty came 
Into our house and wept. 

J. CORSON MIIXER.

GREAT DISTANCE 

How can you be so far away? 
When I have been in pain before 
I've found you standing just outside 
My body's door, 
In patient silence waiting there, 
That I might feel your spirit near. 

But now, with every breath I take, 
It seems that you have farther gone, 
And I become more wide awake, 
And more alone. 

In all this world there is no light; 
No open doorway here to-night. 

I lay my body on the bed, 

And cross my arms, and think of death, 

And think, nine hundred miles away, 

You draw calm breath. 

At last, imagination through 

That distance reaches out to you. 

Now you are leaning on your hand, 
And staring at an empty book. 
You raise your eyes; you understand: 
I feel your look 

Pierce through me. In this foreign place 
You reach me, and I know your face. 
157 



I swear that then our hands did touch, 

And all my fainting pain is gone; 

I know that you did touch my hand. 

Each is alone. 

Yet loneliness begins to seem 

Like sleep, and will become a dream. 

HAROLD MONRO.

THE SCOURGE 

LOVE is not velvet of a courteous shade 
To put a garment on my nakedness 
And fool me into thinking I was made 
For the assurance of a solar dress. 
The love I know is not a silken thing 
Spun out of little hungers and a lie; 
It does not compliment my soul, nor cling 
As velvet clings to arm and breast and thigh. 

Love can be harsh as any hairy mesh 

That monks endure beneath their cassock coats 

To draw the blood from their too-earthly flesh 

The hair of horses and the hair of goats. 

Tonight against my ribs I feel the curt 

And pre-Elizabethan horse-hair shirt! 

VIRGINIA MOORE.

DOG 

A COOL wet nose that searches for your hand; 

The venture of a tongue that asks: "Why linger?" 

A question that is also a command 

Worded hy gentle teeth on captured finger; 

A begging paw to conquer with its charm. 

Enslavement to a personal appeal; 

A leap ahead that seems to say: "What harm 

To follow me no matter how you feel?" 

A pause, a quick discarding of such means 

Of drawing lazy humans out of doors; 

A challenge, an insistency that seams 

A brow with ancient care a gaze that scores 

A victory demanded by the whole 

Weight and pressure of a brown-eyed soul.

LEADED GLASS SAINT 

Y ou shaped those colored hits the tales they spun 
Around your life and joined them with such skill 
That there evolved with glassy fringe and frill 
iTour saintly pattern marvel ously done. 
\&d thus, for all your checkered life, you won 
His soul, and did not rest in quiet until 
He raised you up and framed you in to fill 
His Gothic window opening to the sun. 

But you, resorting to the blind device 
As old as woman, set his house aflame. 
How you glowed up! But in that glow, alas, 
The lead that joined you melted down like ice; 
And you, collapsing in the window frame, 
Fell out a little heap of hroken glass.

LOVE, 

T.HE girl they loved walked in through the door 

As dead as a valley in autumn, 

And neither turned his head her way 

Nor asked of her why she had sought him; 

But they stared at the embers, and neither said, 

"She is standing behind us that is dead!" 

Though a moment before one had whispered, "My 

friend!" 

And his friend, "My more than brother, 
We alone shall see that face to the end 
With the smile that she gave no other," 
Neither cried out, "Behind my chair 
She stands and her hands are above my hair!" 

Though one had said, "There is none but you, 
Since Heaven has chosen and blest us, 
And we alone in the skeleton hands 
Could know the hands that caressed us," 
Neither said, "Welcome!" neither sought 
To take the hand that she stretched out. 

They did not doubt that she was there 

Like a perished sky in the autumn, 

So still they grew, so cold their hearts 

Grudging the hope she had brought him, 

Each waited as if turned to stone 

To feel her hands, to taste alone 

The triumph in his flesh and bone. 

FRANK O'CONNOR.

TIME HAS A WAY 

TIME has a way with flesh that is more cruel 

Than any ruin it may work on stone. 

Time is a fire, and craves no sweeter fuel 

Than lissom limb, clean blood, and virile bone. 

You, who today are wind and bloom, tomorrow 

Will be a dismal and decrepit thing; 

And I too gouty and infirm for sorrow 

That hands no longer burn or warm lips cling. 

Oh, grant me sorcery of words to fashion 
A crypt of song to guard your loveliness, 
Where you may come, some drear day when our 

passion 

Has turned to kindliness, or something less, 
And muse half wistful, half incredulous: 
"Was I so fair, and did he love me thus!" 

TED OLSON.

YOUNG ICARUS 

THROUGHOUT the island of the minotaur 

Sleep lay on every leaf. 
The sea was but a thin green bar 

Strewn with a raveled grain, a sheaf 
Of glinting morning gold. 

Young Icarus, with fingers whittled cold, 

Raised up an arc of feather, 
And Daedalus, with fingers colder, 

Fastened the wings upon his son together, 
And blessed each burdened shoulder. 

The dawn slid in upon the sea and foamed 

Against the bouldered dark, 
And up the gloom an eagle roamed, 

Screaming at lowered stars, while winged, stark 
Lithe Icarus took heed: 

"Not high nor low, but middle, is our need. 

Stay between cloud and cloud . . ." 
But suddenly dark Diaedalus, amazed, 

Opened his wings and with a warning loud 
Cried to a light that blazed. 

Young Icarus aloft, a crystal spear, 

Shattered the pallid hour. 
The roaming eagle shied in fear 

And spiraled downward, outward from a show 
Of splinter-laden light. 

164 



And then, upon the pinnacle of sight, 

A spark shot fire and broke, 
And down the zenith's azure wall 

Careened an arrow with a head of smoke 
That slanted in the fall. 

Old Daedalus flung out his knotted arms, 

But far away was he 
From where, amid the gull-alarms, 

The body of his son unlocked the sea 
With flame-surrendered wings. 

Old Daedalus flew on . . . and many things 

He gave the children of his land 
Before the distant waves had spun 

A covering of shell and weed and sand 
For what he gave the sun. 

GEORGE O'NEIL.

DECEIVERS EVER 

THE air vibrates and shines. 

The wind whistles a tune, 

Clouds are creamy as curds, 

Birds will be singing soon; 

But the songs of larks in the air 

Were dead music if she 

Of the buttercup -yellow hair 

Were cold in a glance to me. 

If she were not in the wet corn 

At morn by the grassy dun 

The boon I would crave from God 

Were sods for my roof-tree soon. 

The calm follows the storm 
That stripped my soul bare. 
Housed in the branching hair 
Of her I name no more 
Limb -warm 

With love's soft raiment o'er 
Head and bosom and heart 
I swore, 

I swore by the grace God gave her, 
I swore by her candle-bright hands 
That the mortars of God's thunder 
That rive the hills asunder 
Should scathless leave the wonder 
Of loves untorn apart. 
166 



I think it was a week ago 

She gave her mouth to Maurice Keogh. 

The calm follows the storm, 
The flame kisses the stone; 
Let the winds moan, 
My feet in the ashes are warm.

THE LAMPLIGHTER 

HERE to the leisured side of life. 
Remote from traffic, free from strife, 
A cul-de-sac, a sanctuary 
Where old quaint customs creep to die 
And only ancient memories stir, 
At evening comes the lamplighter, 
With measured steps, without a sound, 
He treads the unalterable round; 
Soundlessly touching one by one 
The waiting posts, that stand to take 
The faint blue bubbles in his wake; 
And when the night begins to wane, 
He comes to take them back again, 
Before the chilly dawn can blight 
The delicate frail buds of light.

THETIS AND THE AUNTS 

THREE old cats of covert claw 
Sitting round the parlour fire: 
What they thought of what they saw 
Made the walls perspire. 
In the morning they will waken 
(Drear the day and dawn forsaken) 
With Rebuke distilled by gallons 
And acutely tingling talons. 

Thetis, only just sixteen. 

Posing to the looking-glass 
Doesn't yet know she was seen 

("Nothing on!" "The brazen lass!") 

On her left, a candle, warm; 

On her right, a moonray, cold; 
Her dim lily-slender form 

Half in silver, half in gold. 

Moonray thought: " *Tis Dian, sped 
Before me to receive me home"! 

Candle thought: " 'Tis Psyche fled 

From Venus and the wrath to come"! 

Mirror mused: **My well of Truth 
Brims with an immortal sign: 

All of Beauty, all of Youth, 
One eternal moment mine" ! 
169 



Old jute carpet felt like tears 
Where her flitting shadow fell, 

Where her feet caressed his years: 

"I was young," he thought, "as well." 

Old lace curtain held his breath, 
Laying the print of flowers tied 

With ribbon, like a bridal wreath, 
Motionless against her side. 

Tinsel text above her bed 

Bloomed a rose without a thorn: 

"GOD IS LOVE." Its fragrance shed: 
"Christ was of a maiden born." 

Tumbled shift across her chair 

Clasped the ghost of warmth, and slept; 
Dreamed her guileless bosom there, 

Heard the happy heart that leapt. 

Thetis thought (White hip out-thrust, 

Arm upraised, bright cheek on shoulder) 

"Rather nice! I hope I'm just 
A shade less skinny when I'm older. 

"In two more years I'll be eighteen 
I shall always bob my hair . . . 

I'm pinky where my strings have been 
I rather like that bit just there. . . . 
170 



"Greek girls ran about like this! 

Somewhat awful ! All the same 
There's a frightful lot we miss 

Modern life's a hit too tame. . . . 

"Fancy Aunty Dot like me! 

Oh! It's hateful growing old 
Grey and deaf and crotchety 

Dead and buried . . . ugh! Fm cold." 

Then she pirouetted, twice; 

Smiled at herself and kissed one arm 
" 'Hush 99 ! She thrilled like fire in ice! 

"Door clicked ! . . . Nothing . . . False alarm.' 

Three old cats of cunning claw 

Sitting round the parlour fire: 
What they thought of what they saw 

Turned their whiskers wire. 
Thetis, in the morn will waken 
(Or I'm very much mistaken) 
To a discourse on Divinity 
Mewed crescendo by the Trinity. 

KARL PARSONS.

HISTORY OF TWO SIMPLE LOVERS 

FULL of her long white arms and milky skin 
He had a thousand times remembered sin. 
Alone in the press of people travelled he, 
Minding her jacinth and myrrh and ivory. 

Mouth he remembered: the quaint orifice 
From whence came heat that flamed upon the kiss, 
Till cold words came down spiral from the head, 
Grey doves from the officious tower illsped. 

Body: it was a white field ready for love. 

On her body's field, with the gaunt tower above, 

The lilies grew, beseeching him to take. 

If he would pluck and wear them, bruise and break. 

Eyes talking: Never mind the cruel words, 
Embrace my flowers but not embrace the swords. 
But what they said, the doves came straightway 

flying 
And unsaid: Honor, Honor, they kept crying. 

\ 

Importunate her doves. Too pure, too wise. 
Clambering on his shoulder, saying, Arise, 
Leave me now, and never let us meet, 
Eternal distance now command thy feet. 
172 



Predicament indeed, which thus discovers 
Honor among thieves, Honor between lovers. 
Of such a little word is Honor, they feel! 
But the grey word is between them cold as steel. 

At length I saw these lovers fully were come 
Into their torture of equilibrium: 
Dreadfully had forsworn each other, and yet 
They were bound each to each, and they did not 
forget. 

The beauty of their bodies was the bond 
Which these incarnate might not pass beyond; 
Invincible proud Honor was the bar 
Which made them not come closer but stay far. 

And rigid as two painful stars, and twirled 
About the clustered night their prison world, 
They burned with fierce love always to come near, 
But Honor beat them back and kept them clear. 

Ah the strict lovers, they are ruined now! 

I cried in anger. But with puddled brow 

Devising for those gibbeted and brave 

Came I descanting: Man, what would you have? 

For spin your period out, and draw your breath, 
A kinder saeculum begins with Death. 
Would you ascend to Heaven and bodiless dwell? 
Or take your bodies honorless to Hell? 
173 



In Heaven you have heard no marriage is, 
No white flesh tinder to your lecheries, 
Your male and female tissue, sweetly shaped, 
Sublimed away, and furious blood escaped; 

Great lovers lie in Hell, the stubborn ones 
Infatuate of the flesh upon the bones; 
Stuprate, they rend each other when they kiss, 
The pieces kiss again no end to this. 

But still I watched them spinning, orbited nice. 
Their flames were no more radiant than their ice. 
I dug in the quiet earth and wrought the tomb 
And made these lines to memorize the doom: 

Equilibrists lie here; stranger, tread light; 
Close but untouching in each other's sight; 
Mouldered the lips and ashy the tall skull, 
Let them lie perilous and beautiful. 

JOHN CROWE RANSOM.

LADY LOST 

THIS morning, flew up the lane 
A limid lady bird to our birdbath 
And eyed her image dolefully as death; 
This afternoon, knocked on our windowpane 
To be let in from the rain. 

And when I caught her eye 
She looked aside, but at the clapping thunder 
And sight of the whole earth blazing up like tind 
Looked in on us again most miserably, 
Indeed as if she would cry. 

So I will go out into the park and say, 
"Who has lost a delicate brown-eyed lady 
In the West End Section? Or has anybody 
Injured some fine woman in some dark way, 
Last night or yesterday? 

"Let the owner come and claim possession, 
No questions will be asked. But stroke her gently 
With loving words, and she will evidently 
Resume her full soft-j aired white-breasted fashion 
And her right home and her right passion." 

JOHN CROWE RANSOM.

HISTORY 

WHEN Xerxes beat the sea with rods 
Till bridge and sea were reconciled, 
What woman out of all his train 
Took note of the event, and smiled, 
And pondered in her heart of hearts, 
"The Emperor of Asia this?" 
Then gathered Xerxes in her arms, 
Uncertain if to shake or kiss.

THREE 

WE, sitting here together and yet apart; 

The one of us with keen eyes and chin, watching; 

The other one of us smiling across to his girl; 

And I dreaming 

Dark subtle high dreams of when 

We sat thus in Babylon, or maybe in Erech, 

And one of us watched eagerly, hawk-nose a-quiver, 

The tumbler do that difficult trick; 

The other (our host) smiling across 

To the naked babyish little concubine dancing; 

And I dreaming 

That all the pearls of the Gulf 

Grew on the tips of her toes.

THE CAT 

PLEASURES, that I most enviously sense, 

Pass in long ripples down her flanks and stir 
The plume that is her tail. She deigns to purr 

And take caresses. But her paws would tense 

To flashing weapons at the least offense. 
Humbly, I bend to stroke her silken fur. 
I am content to be a slave to her. 

I am enchanted by her insolence. 

No one of all the women I have known 
Has been so beautiful, or proud, or wise 
As this Angora with her amber eyes. 

She makes her chosen cushion seem a throne, 
And wears the same voluptuous, slow smile 
She wore when she was worshiped by the Nile.

SUBURBAN DAWN 

NOTHING is paler than suburban dawn; 

Nothing in mountain forests have I seen 

More shyly tranquil than the dappled fawn 

Of daybreak crossing squares of dusty green. 

Dawn is a white doe pasturing between 

The hedge and house, the sidewalk and the lawn, 

Cropping the berried bush of darkness clean 

While all the curtains in the town are drawn. 

Over the pavement lean the dreaming trees 
With lashes of their drowsy leaves turned down; 
Brown ivy-sparrows tune their morning glees; 
The day is trying on her newest gown 
And dons it quickly, hearing on the breeze 
The whistle of the first train into town.

ON THE LAKE 

A CANDLE lit in darkness of black waters, 

A candle set in the drifting prow of a boat. 

And every tree to itself a separate shape, 

Now plumy, now an arch; tossed trees 

Still and dishevelled; dishevelled with past growth, 

Forgotten storms; left tufted, tortured, sky-rent, 

Even now in stillness; stillness on the lake, 

Black, reflections pooled, black mirror 

Pooling a litten candle, taper of fire; 

Pooling the sky, double transparency 

Of sky in water, double elements, 

Lying like lovers, light above, below, 

Taking, from one another, light; a gleaming, 

A glow reflected, fathoms deep, leagues high, 

Two distances meeting at a film of surface 

Thin as a membrane, sheet of surface, fine 

Smooth steel; two separates, height and depth, 

Able to touch, giving to one another 

All their profundity, all their accidents, 

Changeable mood of clouds, permanent stars, 

Like thoughts in the mind hanging a long way 

off, 

Revealed between lovers, friends. Peer in the water 
Over the boat's edge; seek the sky's night-heart; 
Are they near, are they far, those clouds, those 

stars 

Given, reflected, pooled? are they so close 
For a hand to clasp, to lift them, feel their shape, 
180 



Explore their reality, take a rough possession? 

Oh no! too delicate, too shy for handling, 

They tilt at a touch, quiver to other shapes, 

Dance away, change, are lost, drowned, scared; 

Hands break the mirror, speech's crudity 

The surmise, the divining; 

Such things so deeply held, so lightly held, 

Suhtile, imponderable, as stars in water 

Or thoughts in another's thoughts. 

Are they near, are they far, those stars, that 

knowledge ? 

Deep? shallow? solid? rare? The boat drifts on, 
And the litten candle single in the prow, 
The small, immediate candle in the prow, 
Burns brighter in the water than any star.

ALL-SOULS' DAY 

CLOSE- WRAPPED in living thought I stand 
Where death and daybreak divide the land, 
Death and daybreak on either hand 

For exit and for entry; 

While shapes like wind-blown shadows pass. 
Lost and lamenting, "Alas, alas, 
This body is only shrivelling grass, 

And the soul a starlit sentry 
Who guards, and as he comes and goes, 
Points now to daybreak's burning rose, 
And now toward worldhood's charnel close 

Leans with regretless warning". . . 

I hear them thus O thus I hear 

My doomed companions crowding near, 

Until my faith, absolved from fear, 

Sings out into the morning, 
And tells them how we travel far, 
From life to life, from star to star; 
Exult, unknowing what we are; 

And quell the obscene derision 
Of demon-haunters in our heart 
Who work for worms and have no part 
In Thee, O ultimate power who art 

Our victory and our vision.

RE-WOVEN 

EVER so long ago, 

Under a purple awning, 

Beside the slow gurgle of a fountain 

In a white-hot courtyard, 

Solomon spoke of the fact to Sheba 

But it was true before that 

There is nothing new under the sun. 

Ever so long ago. 

We ran out of thread 

For the tapestry we are all weaving. 

And we learned how to ravel it out 

And weave it all over again 

Into another picture . . . 

When the late spring rains 

Are touching the Pueblo of Isleta 

And the locusts are heavy with flowers, 

And the beautiful Tewa women, 

With a delicate memory of the East in their tran- 
quil faces, 

And with long strings of silver dollars hung on red 
calico dresses, 

Are singing in Latin for the feast of Saint Augus- 
tine, 

To the sure rhythm of a rattle 

Made from the shell of a painted turtle. 

184 



And within the white adobe walls of Isleta, 

Where the air is fragrant with the smell of new 

rain on trodden earth, 

And hright with the moving of eagle feathers, 
The Tewa men 

Dance fervently before the chapel, 
With white lace surplices 
Tucked into blue flannel chaparajos. 

Ever so long ago, 
Under a purple awning, 
Solomon spoke. . . .

FUNERAL 

WHILE I was waiting for the neighbor folk 

I went down through the orchard, where in rows 

There stood the last few dying apple trees 

The Willow Twigs, the Wealthys and the Snows. 

And I remembered how he used to say, 
When first he spaded up the hillside loam : 

"This land is rough and just a trifle thin 

But with some maples it will look like home.*' 

I saw his wood-pile and his chopping block 
(He always split his stovewood straight and neat.) 

I walked back where his blue-grass pasture spread 
And stopped to see his field of winter wheat. 

His barn was empty they had turned his team 
Out in the corn-stalks and the harness hung 

Right there upon the pegs and near the shed 
There lay a neck-yoke by his wagon tongue. 

I went inside the house the preacher talked 
He did his best but these young chaps don'L know 

Just what to say about a man who came 
To plant the groves and fruit-trees, years ago.

INDIANS! 

(Deer field Memorial Hall) 
DULCIMER, play me a little tune 

Mercy, died at the age of two, 
Read the tablets, and find her name, 
"Killed on the door-stone" does it say? 
(Whimpered once as the Redskin came), 
I remember the winter day. 
What shall I play? 

Dulcimer, play me a dancing tune 

David trod them merrily, 

"Died on the Meadows," as settlers die, 

(You passed the meadowy piled with hay)? 

And never a curl to know him by; 

fig or reely or a minuet? 

What shall I play? 

Dulcimer, play me a song of love 

Hannah Sheldon., thirty-nine, 

Died like a woman beside her man. 

There's the door where they hacked their way, 

Back in the days of good Queen Anne; 

Bullets or scalps, or a ransom to pay. 

What shall I play? 

187 



Dulcimer, dulcimer, play no more! 
Or tell me a tune of wedding-bells 

Eunice, Joanna, little ones., 
"Redeemed** 9 at last, but they chose to stay,, 
Married their savages, bore them sons, 
Happily prayed as Redskins pray 

Ancient dulcimer, dusty old friend, 
Praise be for the story's end ! 

LEONORA SPEYER.

ANARCHY 

IN the dark, In bed, the brows of lovers will touch 
Closely, with nothing at all between bone and bone, 
Coffer against coffer of mind, and they will not 

move. 

Silent they'll be, their hearts overflowing with love, 
Or sometimes kiss and whisper, or sweetly moan. 
Yet silent or whispering, lying two lovers alone, 
Locked from the world in the dark, they are sepa- 
rate still, 

An impassable gulf between, across which they call 
Like voice to voice from shores of a lightless sea. 
A moment, surrendered in climax of ecstasy 
Only aware of souls' and bodies' kiss 
They may burn with the wordless knowledge of 

mutual bliss, 

Completeness of giving; yet the flush of fever goes, 
And its flame dies; and gateways noiseless close, 
And behind are wings again, and lonely flight, 
The cold swift mathematical movement of thought, 
Or wandering memory straying like a moth in the 
night. 

Thus lovers, and by day 

Of all they think, how little the dearest can say. 
Even those most pure and devoted must daily wage 
The wars of love and the sweet diplomacies 
Where self will plot for its ends in a fair disguise, 
Or yield to love, for the sake of love, with seeming. 
189 



And coldness they sometimes know and even rage 
Remorsefully checked, and days divorced when the 

dreaming 
Of ohscured and oblivious love is forgotten; and 

scheming 

And striving in the world the ego fights for its own. 
And neglect of love may hring of lovers the best 
To a place where a careless petulant word expressed 
May open before their feet a gulf of dread 
In whose depths is the dreadful image of love lying 

dead, 
And they shrink from a lonely life without ever a 

friend. . . . 

Though they love and would die for each other; and 
will to the end. 

Thus these most close and dear, 

Even these with whom the pitiful heart has been 

bared 
In its weakness, and shame's most intimate secrets 

shared, 
(Though candour's utter prostration could never 

disclose 
The whole of that secret world that so quickly 

grows). 
And of others how little we know, that we know for 

true, 
The strangers we call our friends; we see what they 

do 

190 



For an hour a day may be, and hear what they 

think 

For an hour a year; and ever we stand on the brink 
Of rash disclosure; and ever in fear we shrink 
With a friendly smile lest dreadfully there should he 
A stripping of enmity's naked roots, or afraid 
In all our friendship's complicate web to see 
A fabric of exploitation or trust betrayed. . . . 
A conventional waiving of self as we talk, a pretence 
That the caverns of self are not there, a thick wall 

of defence 

From acquaintance, yet ever there glowers the un- 
sleeping within. 
And, beyond, each one has a world of foes; each 

man 
Will anger to blood against person and class and 

clan, 

Swayed by suspicion, and fear and hate and lust, 
And conflict of loves that is ever the most unjust. 
And out on the verge of the world are the tribes of 

sin 

Whose good is our evil, whose alien instincts show 
In their eyes, deep secular thoughts that we never 

could know. 
A chequered tempestuous world where the watcher 

sees 

Men coveting, fighting and dying, an endless strife 
In ignorant fever for power and pride and life: 
The destined prey of the hosts of desire and disease. 



191 



Yet sighs the absurd unreasoning voice of our 

blood 
For a world, alas! and there is no bitter cold 

there, 
Nor scorching heat, nor blossom with worm in the 

bud, 
And babes do not die, nor blindness comes to the 

old there, 
But the sun shines fair, and the rain falls soft, and 

the clime 
Conspires with the seed for the loveliest fruits of 

time, 
And the young are strong, and the old go green to 

the grave 

Without pain, and none is master and none is slave. 
And music sounds from the boats, and garlands are 

woven 

By maids at noon, and great calm statues are cloven 
Out of the cliffs, by the shrines of sunnier gods. 

Divine, magnificent spirit of man that will face 

Invincible ever the battle with hopeless odds 

And cannot but dream ere he falls of a time and 

a race, 

Of a day when the world of men maturer grown 
Will live without law in perfect wisdom and grace 
Like the solar system hanging in awful space, 
Its parts sustained serenely by love alone!

NIGHT ECSTASY 

ENOUGH for me 

To steal down in the night and see 

The home that holds my love, 

Now with a flickering of stars above; 

The handed Pleiades, 

Orion thrusting a shoulder above the trees, 

Planting his feet on bare elm boughs 

That touch my loved one's window, till over her 

house 

He climbs on high; and all the stars declare 
An ancient Wisdom everywhere 
Working upon a vast design, 
Unknown? nay, clearly known to me 
When in the silent night I see 
How, climbing up her long ancestral line, 
The Spirit shines on high in this fair love of mine. 

thought that blinds and stuns ! 
Not being born in a day 
Of star-dust and of winds at random play, 
Her beauty, rooted in most distant suns, 
With helium and uranium, runs 
Back to primeval night, 
Back to the spear-thrust of emerging light 
When out of abysmal glooms 

Fire flowered in huge fronds and fans and plumes, 
And chaos rolling angry eyes 
Saw order dawning in disordered skies, 
193 



While storms of purple, red and yellow hues 

Drew to a point in contemplative blues: 

For God was weaving the floating mesh 

Of worlds, bone of her bone, flesh of her flesh. 

Now chaos in complete 

Subjection at her feet 

Lies conquered; yellow now 

Builds a triumphal arch above her brow, 

And in the sun-rise of her face 

All colours straitly take their place 

As courtiers, bearing due 

Obedience to her eyes' clear contemplative blue. 

Enough for me 

Looking far down the depth of life to see 
In Him who dwells at mind's eternal noon, 
Thinking a sun, and out of a sun a moon, 
There, more than moon or sun, she hath a part 
Deep in the Spirit of supreme control, 
Who is the heart of my beloved's heart, 
Soul of her soul. 

But he hath many an aeon striven 
To lift dull earth up nearer heaven. 
Striven, too well I know, 
Mid lamentation, pain and woe, 
And I have thought the while, 
Hath it not been in vain, 
The labour and the pain? 
194 



I think of her and smile, 

No; not in vain! 

Though blundering forms with tooth and claw 

Blindly rebelled against the angelic law, 

Behold, the long obscured design 

Stands out and shines in this fair love of mine, 

And all the labour and the blindness 

Find their atonement in her loving-kindness. 

Faith, be not terrified, 
Though earth be small and heaven be wide. 
Let suns and moons be multiplied 
Foam of ethereal seas; 
We need not bow to these. 
Surely it were more wise, 
Kneeling before her face, 
To own within her eyes 
Lights of a holy place, 
Love in her heart, truth in her mind, 
A spirit more than the heavens unconfined: 
Here the high secret dwells, not in unmeaning space. 
Then strip away the bands that bind 
Thine eyes, look up and find, 
Though sojourners we are 
Upon a smaller star 
Whirling around no giant sun, 
How well God used a little one 
Of all his worlds, whereon to prove 
The worth of beauty and the beauty of love. 
195 



Enough for me 

With inward eye to see 

Throughout His vast estate 

What is accounted great, 

And what accounted small; 

To see Arcturus blind as fate, 

Sirius singeing the cobalt wall; 

Yet boasting only girth and weight, 

How are they either great or small? 

She, to the inward eye, outshines, 

Yea, and outlives, the Zodiac signs ; 

By love and wisdom and foreseeing 

She transcends them in her being, 

Where spirit lives to Spirit, one with the All-in-all.

AWAKENING 

I THOUGHT: The white dawn breaks 

Into another day for our delight; 

From our warm blood love blossoms into white 

Frail radiance. But then the sky's dark brood 

Bred on the wild peaks westward covered up 

The light, swept over mountain top. 

And the storm shakes 

The wakened mind out of its certitude. 

Only a tired kiss in the ruffled gloom 
Remains of all that harvest of the heart 
Beating between white sheets in that small room 
Upon your breast, but, O love, depths apart. 

H. STUART.

MOUNTAIN WATER 

You have taken a drink from a wild fountain 

Early in the year ; 
There is nowhere to go from the top of a mountain 

But down, my dear; 
And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley 

Will never seem fresh or clear 
For thinking of the glitter of the mountain water 

In the feathery green of the year. 

SARA TEASDALE. 



198 



TO MY SUB-LIMINAL SELF 

How came we thus together? 
Dark Spirit housed in me! 
Bound by what fatal tether 
Closer than claw to feather, 
Or flower to honey-bee? 

Thou wak'st when I am sleeping. 
Ousting me from my throne, 
My past lies in thy keeping, 
I spend long hours in reaping 
The tares that thou hast sown. 

A sage that oft will blunder, 
A saint that stoops to shame, 
In all thy ways a wonder, 
Thou rendest life asunder, 
And I must bear the blame. 

When I am tuned to sadness, 
Thou unabashed wilt play, 
But in thy ribald gladness 
Confusion lives, and madness 
Is never far away. 

Wilt thou be standing by me, 
In Heaven's all- judging day, 
Pleading with them that try me, 
Or wilt thou then deny me, 
And go thy separate way?

"BROTHER" 

I DO not think the rearing of her brood 
Caused Effie much anxiety, although 
Their food meant endless labor at the tubs. 
Brother was eldest of the noisy tribe, 
Swarming about her like so many flies, 
To which each passing year contributed 
Another. 

"Effie," asked a patron once, 
"How can it be that all your children are 
A different color?" 

"My Gawd, honey, 
Dey got a right, for evy one of dem 
Is got a diffrunt paw!" And then she said, 
"Dey worries at me so dat if it warn't 
I fears de law, I'd sholy cut de thoats 
Of evy one of dem!" 

The visitor 

In scandalized amusement quoted this 
Above the teacups late that afternoon, 
And there was laughter, and the rustling sound 
Of costly garments stirred by winds of mirth, 
And a sweet voice cried, 

"Oh, how terrible! 
But aren't they funny?" 

Still, it must be said 
For Effie that her children never lacked 
For food, and that she fed them by her toil. 
Brother's complexion took that festive shade 
200 



Known as "high yellow." He was short and thin, 
But strong, and of an agile wiriness. 
There was a school to which he might have gone, 
But he did not, and no one cared. 

"It made 
No difference." 

That is one view of it. 
As he grew up he learned to cut the grass 
On the green lawns up town, and pull the weeds 
Out of the flower beds, and carry coal, 
And he of service in a score of ways. 
Flowers he loved, and so they grew for him 
In sandy places, and in shady spots 
Where people said no flowers could ever thrive. 
One sweltering summer when a parching drought 
Threatened the growing friends he loved so well, 
He carried water for them tirelessly. 
"Seem lak dey look, en ax me fer a drink 1" 
He said, in explanation of his toil. 
Children, and music too, he loved. 

Now there 

Are men who walk respected through this world, 
With no loves in their hearts as pure as these. 

Brother had other talents. Deference 
Was paid him for his knowledge of the "bones," 
And all their chance peculiarities. 
"Brother kin sho talk to dem bones!" they said 
Of him in dusky circles where he moved. 
Also he knew that grim commodity 
201 



Which those who traffic in such wares call "snow,'* 
But in no wise resemhling God's own snow 
Except in color. 

Then the hootleggers 

Found Brother useful too, for he was small, 
And very quick, and hest of all, he knew 
How to "Lie low, and keep his mouth shut." 

"If 

You want the real stuff, that yellow hoy 
The darkies all call 'Brother,' is the man 
For you to see." 

But on one winter night 

Things did not go so well. Some one had squealed, 
And the police were there. There was a brawl, 
Shouts in the dark, and running feet, and shots, 
Confusion vast and terrible to one 
Whose sole reaction to authority 
Was fear of punishment, and Brother found 
Escape cut off, and foes on every side. 
Driven and desperate, he pulled a knife, 
And stabbed a young policeman to his death. 

They tried him early in a blustering March, 
Convicted him and sentenced him to die. 

Effie was there, and heard the sentence read. 
She wailed, and called on God to help her son, 
And then went home, and drowned her woes in gin. 

One April morning when the air was soft, 
202 



And throbbing with birds' cries, just as the sun 

Appeared, a sinister procession formed 

Within gray prison walls. Two guards in front. 

And then a sad faced chaplain reading prayers, 

And then the prison doctor, and behind, 

Two wardens with a small and shrunken form 

Between them. 

To a dirty ashen shade 
Had the "high yellow" faded, and the step, 
So quick in kindness, and so light in sin, 
Grown slow and heavy, but the march went on. 

No sound from Brother but his shuffling feet. . . . 
Some strange paralysis compact of fear 
And vague incomprehension of the swift 
Crime, and swifter punishment which brought 
This retribution on him, who had not 
In all his life wished harm to any man, 
Held his tongue silent, and no one can tell 
What waves of surging memories there beat 
Upon his dull half-savage consciousness . . . 
His mother's face, perhaps, above the tubs; 
The low -voiced, furtive man who sold him "snow"; 
The flowers that he watered, and the child, 
"Miss Annie's baby," who had loved to walk 
Prattling, beside him while he cut the grass; 
A soft breast in the dark, the smell of musk, 
And all the swift excitement of the flesh; 
The friendly gentleman who sent him for 
The whiskey; or the church choir where he sang 
203 



In proper dignity on Sunday night . . . 
Phantasmagoric snatches of a life 
Cursed to this end before it was begun. 

With still no sound, the path to death he walked, 

But at the end a seat had been prepared, 

A seat whose ghastly comfort roused him from 

His lethargy, for just before the last 

Strap was adjusted, thrilled a broken voice . . . 

66 Oh Marse Jesus, oh please suh, forgive me! 

Oh Marse Jesus, please suh, Oh Marse Jesus" . . . 

The slight form strained and slackened, strained 

again . . . 
Brother had paid, with Christ's name on his lips.

GULLS 

THE sun was shining so upon the river, 
That scattered ice-floes, swaying on the water, 
Seemed winter-lilies, opened and inviting 
Gulls to their slumber. 

But gulls were circling in a nervous pattern, 
Impelled by something other than the morning, 
Searching with darting eye and balanced pinion, 
Wanting no Lethe.

APOCRYPHAL SOLILOQUIES 

Goliath: 

SEE the dazzled stripling stand, 
Naked as an empty hand 
And here am I, a clanking mass 
Blotting out the yellow grass 
With a body only sent 
For the world's astonishment: 
Arms as great as monstrous houghs 
Where no bird would dare to house, 
Fingers like some poisonous growth 
Even jungle-beasts must loathe, 
And a goggling head awry 
Like a black moon in the sky. . . . 
Here I wait, uneagerly 
For the child that faces me, 
Frightened by my length of limb 
And the clean, young grace of him 
Unaware that cheek and brow 
Taste their last of sunlight now. 
Oh, that it were I, not he! 
Oh, that God would take from me 
This power only schooled in harm 
And send it through that puny arm 
With such a fire that it might well 
Break through this hugely rotting shell. . 
But there will be no miracle. 
There is no help. Young David, fly! 

206 



I am destruction's demon, aye, 
Too sick to live, too strong to die. 

David: 

And there he looms, no more defiant 
Than any hill. So that's a giant! 
This is the thing that should alarm me 
More than the sight of hell's own army 
Commanded hy its master devil. 
But this why this is nothing evil! 
Its eyes are cow's eyes, it looks civil, 
A thing that only babes could fear. . . . 
But I what am I doing here? 
What part have I, the least of shepherds, 
Among these hungry spears and scabbards? 
What! Have I tended sheep and cattle 
Only to lead the wolves to battle? 
Am I possessed of howling demons 
That I should seek the blood of humans? 
God, take this madness out of me. 
Give me my pastures, let me be 
Far from this clash of words and weapons 
Where nothing cries and little happens 
Save when a star leaps from the heavens 
Or a new rush of song enlivens 
The heart that beats in balanced measures, 
Unshaken by more passionate seizures. 
See, I will fling this silly pebble 
High in the air and end my trouble 
207 



And pluck harp-strings again till they 
Charm every darker thought away. . . 
Come, old Goliath, come and play! 



Louis UNTERMEYER.

RECOVERY 

THERE must be many days without a storm, 

And many peaceful nights, before this tree 

Can be itself again. The branches hang 

In order now; the leaves are very still 

But the wind upturned and tore them yesterday, 

And all they held was poured into the rain. 

The tree is empty now as an old bell 

Suddenly swung. . . . The darkness gathered here 

Was filled with silent movement, of the shapes 

That never speak. Each bird that fluttered through 

Hung up an echoing wing-beat, like a leaf. 

The gentle winds that hourly wandered in 

Made hesitating music, never lost, 

Nor ever heard by any but the nights 

That folded round the days and darkened them 

All sleeping till the tempest burst about. . . . 

The tree has not lamented what is gone. 

Time, and the open air, and the quiet ground 

Already work together with the wrens 

And noiseless, climbing spiders. They collect 

New treasure now, sufficient for a while. 

MARK VAN DOREN.

CLOUDS BY NIGHT 

THEY pile and scatter in the empty air; they go and 

come again. 
The countryman in a lonely place leans on his staff 

and looks, 
And does not know that he himself is a thing of like 

stuff 
With these forever changing forms that drift across 

the stars and moon.

FRIENDSHIP'S END 

AND if I cannot give my body to you 
Who need not lack for minions of desire. 
Cannot again, as you would have rne do, 
At seeing flame, leap down into the fire, 
Am I then nothing to your lonely mind, 
Having denied this balm unto your flesh? 
Lost to your eager seeking since you find 
Me somehow freer of the carnal mesh? 

So this is how it is with woman then: 
She has no gift except herself to give, 
Her mind is but a mockery to men. 
Her necessary soul too sensitive. 
Even as the tree so must the shadow bend: 
Denial or compliance, friendship's end! 

EDA Lou WALTON.

EVENING: THE MOTORS 

REMORSELESSLY the evening motors pass 
Bearing men home down streets where there will be 
Doorways and windows where behind the glass 
Are lights, and faces that have eyes to see. 
Seeing but nothing, ears to hear that hear 
Nothing, red lips to cry out that cry not 
But speak, speaking quickly, for the fear 
Of seeing shadows that they have forgot. 

The evening motors pass bearing you home 
To words and silence, food, tobacco, sleep 
To sleep, the dark wherein you all are piled, 
Poor fragments of the day, until there come 
Dreams to release from the troubled heart and deep 
The pageantry of thoughts unreconciled. 

ROBERT PENN WARREN.

LANDSCAPE WITH RUINS 



A MILE from where I stand 

Beech-trees grow steeply by a pool 

Where nets are drawn to the land, 

And where the full 

Tide breasts the trout-stream and flows down again 

By rushy promontories : upon the shore 

Out of sea-rocks rude chieftains of the plain 

Have built themselves a tower. 

II 

A stone's throw and the gentler earth had given 

A glebe beside the waves 

To brown Franciscans; many a soul in heaven 

Once knew these graves, 

And counted dearer no known sanctuary 

Than the grey house they fashioned by this bay. 

Ill 

So it was then ; and then the Stranger came, 
And for a space 

These stones still held the pride of an old name 
And of that ancient race, 

And craftsmen set to work with hands less rude 
Than those of old in granite and in wood, 
And for a time it seemed as though the past 
Had found new strength to last. 
213 



IV 

But never Stranger from beyond the seas 

Could value right 

All that had been, or share those memories 

That once had given delight 

To monks that penned them, or to bards that sang 

In the high tower the river's clamour drown'd 

Until no other sound 

Rose but the song with which the rafters rang. 



Nothing, it seems, beneath the constant sun 

But has its natural declension, 

Nor ever can Promethean fire and sword 

Serve but a rightful lord, 

And not be uppermost. Yet who had dreamt, 

Who knew the earth whence sprang so strong a sap, 

That the oak's summer had so soon been spent, 

Or prophesied mishap 

Or such calamity that a later age 

Would find a ruin for its heritage? 

VI 

Now that so many here have found a grave, 
I would that memory 

Were laid down likewise, where the sounding wave 
Alone might dree 

Old grief, and keep fit company with ghosts. 
Bitterness in the heart out of the past 
214 



Were ivy to the oak-tree, and the blast 

Knows well how deep that amorous traitor thrusts. 

VII 

So when Spring draws her swallows to the tower, 

And where the old have gone 

New corbels nest, her spirit should have power 

On men who gaze upon 

Such handiwork, that the birds' cunning might 

Set chisel to the stone with fresh delight. 

VIII 

And all seems natural : that no other house 
But such as the mind's dignity had planned 
Should rise above the windy beechen boughs, 
Nor labour of the hand 

Be spent on baseness, nor be fashioned aught 
That had not given pleasure to fine thought. 

IX 

The tide has set; along the rocky shore 
A fisher wades knee-deep, and eddying 
His cast swirls seaward. Somewhere dips an oar 
Down the still reaches where the evening 
Leads home to islands ; by the monks* low wall 
A heron stands stone still, and distantly 
Out of the darkness comes the incessant call 
Of gannets striking on a shoal at sea. 

R. N. D. WILSON.

DEATH'S HERITAGE 

ALL men are heirs to riches. They inherit 

A vast estate the day that they draw breath. 
They by the right of Eve, and Adam's merit. 

Assume the feudal policies of death. 
Their actions wear his livery. Their thought 

Is the tradition of his seigneurie. 
Their dreams are heirlooms, and their love is 
naught 

But whispers and his fleeting memory. 
But some refuse their heritage. These owe 

Dangerous fealty to life the lord 
That lights them home by ways death does not know 

To Eden by the flashes of his sword 
The poets from the riches of the dead 

Magnificently disinherited. 

HUMBERT WOLFE. 



216 



THE UNCOMMON WOMAN 

I LEAN back through the dark forest of my race, 
and all the floor is heaped with delicate ash 
of leaf and blossom, and husk too small to trace s 
all that is left of man's imperious flesh, 

made manifest 

in battle, love, and the journey to the Islands of the 
West. 

Not his these scented ashes, this bland air, 
but Nature's only, muttering in her sleep 
"let life go on!" and does not know, nor care, 
if all who live are foundered fathoms deep, 

like sinking wrack 

changing from gold to green, from green to un- 
imagined black. 

Old wars the desperate bid for life by dying 
mix with dust-Edens long ago forgotten, 
and here Gethsemanes in ash are lying 
browner than last year's leaves, as those leaves 
rotten, 

all nature's tricks 
even the last sweet treachery of a Crucifix. 

But woman has a secret that resists 
the magic of the half -gods, as they wind 
their spells with slow, but surely wearying, wrists, 
217 



woman has a secret not all their webs can bind 

the little Powers 

weaving for their own little necks these sacrificial 
flowers. 

What is our secret, Eve? When the coiled snake 
tempts us with knowledge, and we whisper "Yes"? 
What is our secret, Mary? When they take 
our dream and crucify it? And no less 

we must outdream 

the serpent-trick of knowledge, and man's blind 
stratagem? 

What is the secret of women, that jettison 
the Edens that they have for spectral gleams 
of impossible Edens always further on? 
Who offer up the child Jesus of their dreams 

to the sharp nails, 
that hammer into Hell the broken dream that fails? 

What is their secret? Woman is older than man, 

and is not cheated by the manifold pretence 

of life that has no purpose and no plan, 

wooing with spring, and flowers, and trees the sense 

of those, who should 
look into darkness in cold undecorated solitude. 

Woman, that bears, has a higher fate than bearing. 

Woman, that gives, outlasts both giving and taking. 

218 



Woman, that loves, outloves the need of caring. 
Woman, that dies, is moulding death, forsaking 

life's fleeting guesses 
for the rich dark, and sempiternal lovelinesses. 

She is the labyrinth that man has trod 
led by the tapes of love the cozener, 
who in that guidance dreams himself a god, 
and does not guess that in the heart of her 

he is no more 
than, gazing over seas unknown, the Minotaur. 

She is the constant in the bewildering flow 
of numbers, written in chalk on death's long slate, 
to which death has the key, but does not know 
how that one figure, stronger far than fate 

will crash the sum 
in the gold total of her proud Kingdom Come. 

And the Uncommon Woman, whatever shape 
man's wandering fancy gives her, Ashtaroth, 
Psyche, or Eve or Mary, cannot escape 
from that in men and women, transcending both 

the primal trust, 
to which she is appointed, of the patient dust 

twisted and battered, suffering and torn, 
but clamouring ever through its shapeless mouth 
for sheerer peaks than thought's last Matterhorn, 
219 



for swallow-flights past beauty's furthest South, 

for that which must 
be the whole meaning of dust, because it is not dust. 

To that all women are pledged, and do not know it, 
And I, the uncommon woman, who dimly see 
that we are the first conjecture of a poet, 
one line in an unconcerted harmony, 
I will not falter 

myself the flame, I shall not see, upon the unseen 
altar.

SONNET 

WHAT is a poet but a tiny flaw 

Within the massive silent wall of things? 

A trickle of thin beauty, misty law, 

Escaped from their majestic prisonings? 

Harmonies heaven-swelling, wherein we dwell, 

Can only seep, a lessening, broken stream, 

As dim as ocean-echoes in a shell, 

As faint as an almost forgotten dream. 

We are dumb enough, God knows; but life is 

dumber, 

Only the rare dull echo of sweet noise, 
A desert of winter, with an hour of summer, 
A desert of pain, with a far cloud of joys 

Mocking our bitter thirst. Then sing, faint 
breath. 

Though nothing heed you but the ears of death.

A COURTESY 

HAVING conceived that this delight alone 

Must be the corner stone 

For all my building; having stripped it bare 

Of you and found it fair; 

Having accepted deprivation; 

I have knelt down to bow 

My brow upon the brow 

Of granite; I have filled my empty hand 

With running pulse of sand, 

And twined my fingers in a bough of leaves; 

I have pushed back my sleeves 

To let the water twist 

Its coolness round my wrist, 

And I have kissed the comfortable moss 

For cushioning a cross 

Of racking timber sharp as childbirth bed; 

I have embraced instead 

Of love, a ponderable cloud of rain. 

Let us return again 

Together; let us kneel upon the grass 

In quiet clear as glass, 

Bending stiff necks and crooking stubborn knees 

In courteous obsequies 

For that poor wolf, but late mistitled Pride; 

Let us be thankful that this beast has died, 
222 



And thankful for the silence of the trees, 
As I was thankful for the cheer I had 
To hear their chattering when I was sad.

THE STAR 

[ SAW a star shine in bare trees 
That stood in their dark effigies; 
With voice so clear and close it sang 
That like a bird it seemed to hang 
Within the branches, not behind, 
Twigs on its rosy breast outlined. 

A star of such bright amplitude 
It followed with me through the wood; 
All other stars before its sphere 
Pale as their own reflections were; 
The Plough, by pebbly fallow spurned, 
High in the sky lay overturned. 

An obvious moon halving the night 
And haloed by a rainbow light 
Sounded as clear as silver bell; 
The trees in flight before it fell, 
Their shadows straggling on the road 
Where glacier of soft moonlight flowed. 

But moon nor star-untidy sky 

Could catch my eye as that star's eye; 

For still I looked at that same star, 

That fitful, fiery Lucifer, 

Watching with mind as quiet as moss 

Its light nailed on a burning cross.

FROM "GYPSY NIGHTS" 



EVERY night of last week was a Gypsy: 

Two were old, tired hags, dressed in black; 

Three had saved a crescent earring; 

One was a cool child; 

And the last 

Was a young, lithe woman. 

If she hewitched me 

It was because I followed her 

Through twisted tree-branches, 

And if I am mad 

Madness is what I sought.
