He endured much 
No flutter, no song of bird 
There in the sunlight clear. 
"IT IS THE TRUE STAR" 

Through twisted tree-branches, 
He marvel that his heart still beats. 
Too many voices heard, 
in every language even deaf and dumb 

And up the gloom an eagle roamed, 
Lone in high air, 
eyes were dull. 
Sublimed away, and furious blood escaped; 

"let's go" said he 
like a flame-lit flower 
Reach out, reach out, you will touch nothing, 
Even in the breath of stone and iron streets, 
Madness is what I sought. 

Now that the evening shuts with rain, 
He is fighting for his breath. . . 
Swayed by suspicion, and fear and hate and lust, 
so is his heart 

The faint blue bubbles in his wake; 
A story, which we know, will fail 
one can imagine His surprise 
upward vacant eyes, painfully 
But what am I doing here?
