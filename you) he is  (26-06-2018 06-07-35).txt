you) he is 
me why people let go 
and lay still 
sing terribly afar in the lost lands. 
long enough and just so long 
the great advantage of being alive 
perfectly speak 
see i will comfort you 
without breaking anything. 
can be) 
yes closer 
be beautiful 
my treasure, 
love is more thicker than forget 82 
Hand in a window 
except in your 
darling. And if i sing you are my voice, 
you're killing me 
no heart can leap,no soul can breathe 
and carve immortal jungles of despair 
and high beyond high 
your slightest look easily will unclose me 
and here is a secret they never will share 
kumrads die before they're old 
love is less always than to win 
here's a little mouse) and 
go slow said she 
may i stay said he 
every finger shall have its ring 
i never knew and neither did you
