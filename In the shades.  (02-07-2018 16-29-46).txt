In the shades. 
in fifty thousand years 
Into stations of dawn. 
"Why should I wish for other men 
Let us return again 
believe me 
One thing was certain : 
But what is that to you? 
voices to voices, lip to lip 
The blood rushed through her veins and yet 
The pale lips part again 
and lay still 
My hands are slack; my blood is cold; 
Where nothing cries and little happens 
much more than very much 
that if your lips, which i have loved, should touch 
what a wonderful thing 
Now with a flickering of stars above; 


He endured much 
Too many voices heard, 
Madness is what I sought. 
But what am I doing here? 
Reach out, reach out, you will touch nothing,
